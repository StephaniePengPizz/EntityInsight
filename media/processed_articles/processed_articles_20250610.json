Ltd. are among the other issuers working on deals.\nThey are turning to the bond market before a hotly-anticipated US tariff announcement on April 2, which Trump has referred to as “Liberation Day.” Although the threat of rising tariffs has made investors nervous, it hasn’t been entirely bad news for bond issuers: Treasury yields have fallen as investors weigh up the economic impact, reducing issuers’ overall funding costs, while investment grade bond spreads in Asia remain tight.\n“With Treasuries having rallied and credit spreads still near all-time tights, the Asian dollar primary market has sprung to life, with multiple issuers keen to lock in funding ahead of ‘Liberation Day,’” said Mark Reade, head of credit strategy at Mizuho Securities Asia.\nIssuers in Asia Pacific have already sold almost $92 billion of dollar bonds so far this quarter, the highest quarterly volume since the first three months of 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nRead: Trump Plans His Tariff ‘Liberation Day’ With More Targeted Push\nTrump is planning a series of so-called reciprocal tariffs, hitting countries that impose their own levies on US goods.

But in our Chart of the Day today, we wanted to highlight how the growth of Nvidia's actual products is just as astonishing.\nThe AI chip leader uses a metric called \"AI FLOPS\" which stands for floating-point calculations per second. The company provided Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton with a breakdown of how many FLOPs each of its GPUs over the past several years has been able to hit.\nHopper, first launched in 2022, maxed out at 3,958 FLOPs. Nvidia's new Blackwell chip hits about 20,000 FLOPs.\nYou don't have to understand the granular parts of AI computing, or even what a FLOP is, to see this chart and comprehend why Nvidia is winning the AI race by a landslide right now. The productivity of the product they're selling to end users has skyrocketed just like their stock price.\nTue, May 27, 2025 at 6:30 PM UTC\nAlexandra Canal\nTrump's tariffs and the 'transitory' debate\nYahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports:\nThere is now a \"healthy debate\" within the Federal Reserve about whether any inflation triggered by President Trump’s tariffs\nwill prove to be transitory\n, according to Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari.\nSome policymakers are arguing for \"looking through\" the impact of the duties as temporary, but Kashkari identified himself as belonging in the other camp of officials who believe trade talks could take \"months or years\" to resolve and said, \"There could be tit-for-tat tariff increases as trading partners respond to one other.\"\nThus Kashkari wants to keep rates steady \"until there is more clarity on the path for tariffs and their impact on prices,\" he added while speaking in Tokyo Tuesday. \"I find these arguments more compelling given the paramount importance I place on defending long-run inflation expectations.\"\nOne of the big questions facing central bank policymakers at the moment is what effect Trump's trade policies will have on the direction of inflation and the US economy.\nThe White House has argued that the Fed should view any price increases as a one-time event, with Trump himself repeatedly calling for the Fed to lower rates, but many Fed officials have made it clear they are not sure which way things will go.\nThe uncertainty highlights the dilemma for the central bank as it tries to weigh both sides of its mandate — stable prices and maximum employment — at a time when the true effects of White House trade policies on the economy are still unknown.\nRead more here.\nTue, May 27, 2025 at 5:45 PM UTC\nAlexandra Canal\nTesla stock rises 6% as Elon Musk commits more time to the company\nTesla (\nTSLA\n) stock jumped around 6% in afternoon trading on Tuesday after Elon Musk announced he'll be spending more time at the EV maker and his other businesses.\nThe stock, which was a top trending ticker on Yahoo Finance, also gained momentum following President Trump's\ndelay of a 50% tariff on the European Union\n, easing fears of a trade conflict. Together, these updates drove Tesla’s shares to the upside and supported overall positive sentiment in the market.\nNasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price\n•\nUSD\nTesla, Inc.

He added he \"must be super focused on 𝕏/xAI and Tesla (plus Starship launch next week), as we have critical technologies rolling out.\"\nThe news comes as Tesla EV registrations (a proxy for sales) in Europe fell a whopping 49% in April compared to a year ago, to 14,228. Meanwhile, overall EV registrations in the region (which includes the UK and the European Free Trade Association) rose 34.1% in April, with overall registrations down 0.3%.\nRead more here.\nTue, May 27, 2025 at 5:04 PM UTC\nJosh Schafer\nHow consumers are changing their spending habits as tariff uncertainty bites\nConsumer confidence surprisingly\nrebounded in May\nas respondents digested the tariff pause between the US and China.\nBut in a special question from The Conference Board\nin this month's survey,\nconsumers did express some changes to their spending habits in the past several weeks. Consumers indicated they're saving for future expenses, dipping more into their savings right now than before and postponing some major purchases.\nThese reactions weren't enough to weigh on the overall impact index, but whether or not these responses actually lead to slower consumer spending will remain key to the economic narrative as investors wait to see if heightened tariffs eventually weigh on economic activity.\nTue, May 27, 2025 at 3:52 PM UTC\nAlexandra Canal\nWall Street braces for more bond market turbulence\nWall Street is keeping a close eye on the bond market after long-term Treasury yields spiked last week as investors reassessed the US fiscal outlook in light of\nPresident Trump's proposed tax legislation.\nThe 30-year Treasury yield (\n^TYX\n) surged as high as 5.15% last week, hovering near its highest level since 2007. Yields pulled back slightly in early Tuesday trading, with the 30-year yield dipping back below 5% following reports that Japan's central bank may scale back its own bond issuance.\nStill, investor anxiety remains elevated.\nCboe Indices\n•\nUSD\nTreasury Yield 30 Years (^TYX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\n4.9700\n+0.0410\n+(0.83%)\nAs of 8:55:43 AM CDT. Market Open.\nAdvanced Chart\nWhile ballooning deficits\nhave long been a concern\n, the current wave of unease reflects a collision of both new and familiar threats, with fiscal fears, stubborn inflation, and political uncertainty top of mind. At the center of it all is\nTrump's newly advanced tax bill\n, which cleared the House last week and is now headed to the Senate.\n\"We're concerned about the 10-year and the 30-year in particular as it pertains to the fiscal position, and that makes it much more difficult to forecast,\" Eric Winograd, chief economist at AllianceBernstein, told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.\nHistorically, Treasury yields have followed the business cycle and expectations for Fed policy. But with the \"big beautiful bill\" projected to add\n$4 trillion\nto the national debt over the next decade, fiscal risk has become a key driver of long-term rates.\nThe legislation proposes sweeping cuts to individual and corporate tax rates but lacks swift and substantial spending cuts, deepening investor concerns over the US's\nalready fragile fiscal situation.\n\"There's no evidence of fiscal restraint,\" Winograd said. \"If anything, we're seeing additional fiscal deterioration. As a result, we expect the yield curve to steepen, and that longer-dated yields [will] remain sticky.\"\nTue, May 27, 2025 at 2:55 PM UTC\nAlexandra Canal\nTrump Media to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin\nTrump Media & Technology Group (\nDJT\n) is doubling down on cryptocurrency, unveiling plans Tuesday to create what it claims will be one of the largest bitcoin treasuries held by any public company.\nThe initiative is backed by a $2.5 billion private funding round, with commitments from roughly 50 institutional investors,\naccording to a company press release\n. The deal includes $1.5 billion in Trump Media common stock and $1 billion in convertible senior secured notes, set to close on or around May 29.\nOnce finalized, the move will place bitcoin directly on Trump Media’s balance sheet, alongside existing cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaling $759 million as of the end of Q1 2025.\nNasdaqGM - Nasdaq Real Time Price\n•\nUSD\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp.

The expectations index surged off its 13-year low seen in April, reaching 72.8 in May, far above the 55.4 seen the month prior.\nThe cutoff date for preliminary results was May 19, meaning any opinions swayed by the US-China tariff delay were likely factored in, but the latest tariff back and forth with the European Union and Apple (\nAAPL\n) wouldn't have been accounted for.\n\"The rebound was already visible before the May 12 US-China trade deal but gained momentum afterwards,\" Stephanie Guichard, a senior economist of global Indicators at the Conference Board, wrote in the release. \"The monthly improvement was largely driven by consumer expectations as all three components of the Expectations Index — business conditions, employment prospects, and future income —rose from their April lows.

Traders took it as a sign that Japanese authorities are seeking to restore calm in the world’s third-largest bond market.\n“That potential lower issuance is giving Treasuries a nice helping hand,” said Michael Brown, strategist at Pepperstone Group in London. “For those seeking to buy long-term debt, lower JGB supply could force them into the Treasury complex.”\nBond yields rose across developed markets last week as investors worried about the ability of governments to cover massive budget deficits, pushing 30-year Treasury yields toward levels last seen in 2007. Japan’s bond market has also been squeezed by signs that the central bank may attempt to taper its huge holdings of government bonds further.\nThe chance that Japan’s government will reduce its bond supply goes at least some way to addressing the worries over demand. But it doesn’t address wider concerns about government finances globally, raising the possibility that Tuesday’s bond rally is only a brief pause in the tumult.\nRead more here\n.\nTue, May 27, 2025 at 5:07 AM UTC\nRian Howlett\nAsia-Pacific markets dip as investors weigh US tariff delay, BOJ signals rate hike\nAsia-Pacific markets mostly declined Tuesday as investors digested the implications of US President Donald Trump's decision to defer 50% tariffs on European Union imports, sparking fresh concerns about the global trade outlook.\nOsaka - Delayed Quote\n•\nJPY\nNikkei 225 (^N225)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\n37,470.67\n-494.43\n(-1.30%)\nAt close: 3:45:03 PM GMT+9\n^N225\n^HSI\n^KS11\nAdvanced Chart\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 (\n^N225\n) slipped 0.2% to 37,451.60, while the broader Topix index was flat.

That has led to increasingly hostile commentary from both sides, putting\nlast month's agreement to lower tariffs for 90 days\nin a tenuous position.\nNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett even suggested Sunday on ABC that trade negotiations with other nations are being held up by the wait for this call between Trump and Xi.\nHe explained why his previous predictions of deals have failed to materialize, saying it's because \"the trade team has been focused 100% like a laser beam on the China matter.\" Once a call resolves the China issues, he added, \"then we're going to take [other] deals into the Oval.\"\nBut it's far from unclear whether a call between the two leaders, who apparently have not spoken since before Trump's inauguration, can resolve the growing issues. The uncertainty is more pronounced by weeks of promises that a call is in the offing, with still no clarity on when it will even take place.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed hope on CBS for \"something very soon,\" while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick promised on Fox that Trump is \"going to go work it out\" without offering a timeline.\nHassett added he was hoping for a call this week, but said, \"you never know in international relations.\"\nRead more here.\nToday at 12:33 PM UTC\nJenny McCall\nEU readying 'countermeasures' if tariffs deal with US crumbles\nAP reports:\nThe European Union on Monday said it is preparing “countermeasures” against the United States after the Trump administration's surprise\ntariffs on steel\nrattled global markets and complicated the ongoing wider tariff negotiations between Brussels and Washington.\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed last week to “accelerate talks” on a deal, but that if those trade negotiations fail “then we are also prepared to accelerate our work on the defensive side,\" European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told a press conference in Brussels.\n“In the event that our negotiations do not lead to a balanced outcome, the EU is prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to this latest tariff increase,” Gill said.\nRead more here.\nToday at 12:26 PM UTC\nJenny McCall\nAluminium premium for US buyers soars after Trump doubles tariffs\nAluminium (\nALI=F\n) prices for US buyers jumped on Monday after President Trump said he planned to increase tariffs on imported steel and aluminium from 25% to 50%.\nReuters reports:\nThe US is heavily reliant on aluminium imports.

He defended pieces of the bill — notably tax cuts — and added, \"You have to be realistic about how much we can get done here.\"\nBut the critiques by the three others were withering and quickly noted by other\nlike-minded figures in the tech world\n— and also gleefully highlighted by some of the podcast's hosts — with charges of fiscal irresponsibility and even that the bill was a sort of \"'deep state' Candy Land.\"\nOthers in Silicon Valley have offered their support for certain provisions — notably Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi's praise for\nthe inclusion of gig workers in Trump's no tax on tips plans\n— but other leading voices have been wary or at least quiet on the plans since they passed.\nAnd the next \"All-In episode\" came just a few days later and featured Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), an outspoken critic of the bill who is promising major changes.\nA range of critiques of the bill\nThe opposition from Silicon Valley has been mirrored by at least some voters, as well as respondents to a new Morning Consult survey this week finding 50% were opposed to the reconciliation package after its major components — from tax changes to decreased funding for Medicaid — were defined.\nStory Continues\nThe political pressure has had at least some effect on Trump, who went from\nposting the morning after the bill passed the House\nthat the Senate needed to \"send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!\" to\nsounding much more open to changes\njust a few days later.\nAsked Wednesday afternoon about the criticisms, Trump declined to criticize Musk before adding of the current bill \"I'm not happy about certain aspects of it\" and suggesting at least some changes could be coming.\n\"It's got a ways to go,\" he said of ongoing negotiations.\nA big part of the issue is that Musk and his DOGE allies rode into Washington months ago with giant promises to cut \"at least\" $2 trillion from the government's annual budget, an effort that has shown little results even after causing chaos among the federal workforce and seeing Musk\nrecently take a step back.\nA\ntracker of real-time government spending\nfrom the Brookings Institution shows that overall government spending in calendar year 2025 is actually slightly up from 2024 spending levels, even as the effect of DOGE can clearly be seen on smaller agencies like the US Agency for International Development (USAID).\nIn\na separate interview this week with the Washington Post\n, Musk lamented the criticism and opposition his cost-cutting project engendered, saying, \"DOGE is just becoming the whipping boy for everything.\"\nMusk previously appeared to signal his opposition to the bill when\nhe posted last week\n— as the bill was being debated — that \"the profligacy of government means that only radical improvements in productivity can save our country.\"\nThis week's CBS interview has seen him be much more specific.\n\"I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful, but I don't know if it can be both,\" he joked, adding, \"My personal opinion.\"\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\nBen Werschkul is a Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard\nMore Info\nRecommended Stories"

      "content": "A US trade court just blocked a wide swath of Trump's tariffs. Here are the duties that may be impacted.\nAlexis Keenan\nand\nBen Werschkul\nUpdated\nThu, May 29, 2025 at 8:02 PM GMT+8\n5 min read\nA startling decision Wednesday from the United States Court of International Trade\nappeared to put at least a temporary pause\non many of\nPresident Trump's wide-ranging tariffs\n.\nThe Manhattan-based trade court ruled in an opinion issued by a three-judge panel that a key 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not give Trump \"unbounded\" authority to issue the worldwide and retaliatory tariffs the president has imposed by executive order in recent months.\nMany of the president's actions \"exceed any authority granted to the President by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs,\"\nread the decision\n, which blocked imposition of some of Trump's tariffs and invalidated the president’s orders.\nThe ruling applies to a series of controversial actions that Trump has taken to impose tariffs on entire nations since taking office. The ruling is not expected to impact other actions he has taken focused on specific goods from automobiles to steel, which rely on a different legal authority.\nWhite House spokesperson Kush Desai saids in a statement that \"it is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency.\"\nLate Wednesday, the administration filed a notice with the court stating that it planned to appeal the decision.\nPresident Donald Trump speaks during a swearing in the Oval Office of the White House on May 28. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n·\nAndrew Harnik via Getty Images\nMeanwhile, some of those who brought the cases celebrated. A law professor who helped bring the suit\nwrote a reaction online\nthat suggested the legal wrangling will continue but said, “The bottom line is a major victory in the legal battle against these harmful and illegal tariffs.”\nThe tariff orders were challenged by a New York liquor importer and several other American small businesses, as well as 11 state attorneys general.\nWith the Trump administration's plan to appeal, the matter will likely head to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which has jurisdiction over international trade law disputes. The case could eventually reach the Supreme Court.\nWhich tariffs are at issue\nThe decision's focus on IEEPA immediately throws into doubt some of the most far-reaching of Trump's tariff actions since taking office. Most notably, those include his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs of 10% on nearly the entire world, as well as the current threat of higher tariffs on countries that fail to reach a deal during his 90-day pause.\nThe president has also relied on IEEPA to impose duties on nations such as Mexico, Canada, and China, claiming that the nations' failure to curb the flow of illegal drugs and migration into the US threatened US national security.\nStory Continues\nRead more:\nWhat Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\nThe law was also the authority Trump planned to use when threatening, before deferring, on possible tariffs on Colombia.\nThe White House doubled down on its national security claim on Wednesday evening.\n\"Foreign countries' nonreciprocal treatment of the United States has fueled America's historic and persistent trade deficits,\" said Desai, the White House spokesperson. \"These deficits have created a national emergency that has decimated American communities, left our workers behind, and weakened our defense industrial base — facts that the court did not dispute.\"\nDuties based on other laws like those Trump has imposed on certain aluminum and steel products are not included in the court’s decision.\nRecent duties on automobiles imposed by the president use so-called Section 232 tariff authority, which is derived from a separate law called the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.\nThe tariffs on steel and aluminum\nalso rely on Section 232.\nOther sector-specific tariffs from Trump's first term — and from President Biden's time in office — also often relied on another tariff authority derived from Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs said Thursday they still expected Trump to find other ways — including some of the aforementioned methods — to impose tariffs.\nThe ruling \"might not change the final outcome for most major US trading partners,\" the analysts said.\nA focus on a 1977 law\nThe ruling was immediately celebrated by some of Trump’s critics in Washington. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said in a statement that he \"argued from the start that Donald Trump’s claim that he could simply decree sky-high new taxes on imported goods depended on mangling the Constitution beyond recognition.\"\nOregon was one of the states that brought suit against the Trump administration.\n\"I have no doubt the legal wrangling will continue, but I’m committed to retaking Congress’s authority over trade for good and shutting down Trump’s ability to unilaterally declare trade war with the world,\" Wyden said.\nThe\nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977\nsays that during a national emergency, the president, in order to respond to an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" from abroad, can regulate economic transactions, including imports.\nCongress passed the IEEPA\nto restrict presidents\nfrom overstepping a 1917 World War I-era law known as the Trading With the Enemy Act (TWEA). The act, which regulates US transactions with enemy powers, allowed the president to exercise broad economic power during wartime and during national emergencies.\nIn this case, the trade court ruled that because the Constitution expressly allocates tariff power to Congress, IEEPA does not delegate \"unbounded\" tariff authority to the president. Instead, IEEPA's provisions impose \"meaningful limits\" on the authority that IEEPA confers, the panel said.\nThe court also said the president's tariffs fell short of meeting the IEEPA's requirements because the duties do not address \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" to national security.\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

That has led to increasingly hostile commentary from both sides, putting\nlast month's agreement to lower tariffs for 90 days\nin a tenuous position.\nNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett even suggested Sunday on ABC that trade negotiations with other nations are being held up by the wait for this call between Trump and Xi.\nHe explained why his previous predictions of deals have failed to materialize, saying it's because \"the trade team has been focused 100% like a laser beam on the China matter.\" Once a call resolves the China issues, he added, \"then we're going to take [other] deals into the Oval.\"\nBut it's far from unclear whether a call between the two leaders, who apparently have not spoken since before Trump's inauguration, can resolve the growing issues. The uncertainty is more pronounced by weeks of promises that a call is in the offing, with still no clarity on when it will even take place.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed hope on CBS for \"something very soon,\" while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick promised on Fox that Trump is \"going to go work it out\" without offering a timeline.\nHassett added he was hoping for a call this week, but said, \"you never know in international relations.\"\nRead more here.\nToday at 12:33 PM UTC\nJenny McCall\nEU readying 'countermeasures' if tariffs deal with US crumbles\nAP reports:\nThe European Union on Monday said it is preparing “countermeasures” against the United States after the Trump administration's surprise\ntariffs on steel\nrattled global markets and complicated the ongoing wider tariff negotiations between Brussels and Washington.\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed last week to “accelerate talks” on a deal, but that if those trade negotiations fail “then we are also prepared to accelerate our work on the defensive side,\" European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told a press conference in Brussels.\n“In the event that our negotiations do not lead to a balanced outcome, the EU is prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to this latest tariff increase,” Gill said.\nRead more here.\nToday at 12:26 PM UTC\nJenny McCall\nAluminium premium for US buyers soars after Trump doubles tariffs\nAluminium (\nALI=F\n) prices for US buyers jumped on Monday after President Trump said he planned to increase tariffs on imported steel and aluminium from 25% to 50%.\nReuters reports:\nThe US is heavily reliant on aluminium imports. About half of all aluminium used in the country for transport, packaging and construction is delivered from elsewhere, with the vast majority coming from Canada.

      "content": "Opinion\nThis week in Trumponomics: Too bad TACO isn’t true\nRick Newman\n·\nSenior Columnist\nUpdated\nSun, June 1, 2025 at 8:09 PM GMT+8\n5 min read\nTraders have come up with a snarky shorthand for characterizing President Trump’s trade policy: TACO. Trump Always Chickens Out.\nTrump has whipsawed markets by threatening tariffs, imposing tariffs, raising tariffs, lowering tariffs, and sometimes backing down from tariff threats. Stock values have followed the bouncing tariff in an inverse pattern: down when Trump’s tariffs go up, and vice versa. Investors who have bought the dips, betting that Trump will relent on tariffs and stocks will go back up, have generally done OK.\nThe only problem with the TACO trade is that the premise isn’t true. Trump doesn’t always chicken out. His threats are often worse than his actions, but five months into Trump’s term, it is abundantly clear that taxes on imports will be considerably higher for as long as Trump is in charge.\nTACO joined the financial vernacular after Trump threatened a 50% tariff on imports from Europe, then backed down after European trade negotiators picked up the phone and started talking with Trump about a trade deal that might avert the tariffs. Financial Times columnist Robert Armstrong had\nused the phrase TACO in a May 2 opinion piece\n, but it was Trump’s flip-flop on the Europe tariffs on May 26 that sent the acronym viral.\nRead more:\nWhat Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\nAs\nArmstrong explained\n, the TACO trade is a good thing and markets generally cheer when Trump dials back a tariff threat. Tariffs are a tax on imports that raises costs for everybody who buys an import, and higher costs mean more inflation and lower profits. When Trump backs down on a tariff threat, it means less tax money going to the US Customs Bureau and more staying in consumer and business bank accounts.\nTrump bristles at the taunt. When a reporter asked him about the TACO meme on May 28, Trump called it a “\nnasty question\n” and said, \"They’ll say oh, we was chicken. He was chicken. That’s unbelievable. Usually I have the opposite problem.”\nWASHINGTON,DC - MAY 28:U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a swearing-in ceremony for the interim U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, Jeanine Pirro, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 28, 2025.(Photo by Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n·\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images\nDrop Rick Newman a note\n, take his\nweekly economy quiz\n, or\nsign up for his newsletter\n.\nTrump squawking about whether he’s a chicken is a priceless bit of ironical bravado, but in reality, Trump is right. He threatens absurdly high tariffs the way a homeowner might post an unrealistic asking price when first listing a house for sale. Trump doesn’t do that because he wants to end up at the same tariff level he started at. He does it to end up at a higher tariff level and maybe get something in return.\nIt would be more accurate to say Trump sometimes chickens out. But TSCO isn’t a pithy acronym, and if Trump happened to deescalate a trade threat on a Tuesday, nobody would get the joke if you\njoshed about TSCO Tuesday\n.\nStory Continues\nIf Trump always chickens out, then he’d have the perfect excuse right now to wind down his trade war and move on to something else. Two federal courts recently ruled that Trump’s claim of a “national emergency” to justify most of his new tariffs is unconstitutional. If those rulings survive likely appeals to the Supreme Court, they will sharply curtail Trump’s ability to impose any tariff he wants at any time. It’s an ideal opportunity for Trump to say, well, I tried, and the courts won’t let me do it.\nInstead, Trump is\naggressively challenging both court ruling\ns, with one appeals court finding in Trump’s favor by saying the emergency tariffs can remain in effect until it hears the case. Trump, meanwhile, is\npreparing new tariffs\nunder a wide range of different legal authorities that are more defensible. Those pathways require more prep work while giving Trump less leeway on tariffs, but they could still leave the US economy blanketed by punitive tariffs that suffocate growth.\nRead more:\nThe latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\n“We continue to expect that the administration will prepare alternative means to implement its global reciprocal tariffs while the cases are being considered by the court,” Ed Mills of financial firm Raymond James wrote in a May 29 analysis. “The on-again, off-again impact of the rulings and subsequent pause will continue to compound uncertainty and related market volatility.”\nTrump, so far, has raised the average tax on imported goods from 2.5% to about 18%, according to the\nYale Budget Lab\n. That includes the emergency tariffs that the Supreme Court may or may not allow to stand, plus another set of tariffs on steel, aluminum, cars, and car parts that are on more stable legal footing. Trump’s team is also working up the justification for new tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, which Trump suggests will be coming soon.\nMost analysts think Trump will ultimately end up with an average tariff rate between 15% and 20%. At current levels, with the emergency tariffs in effect, the Yale Budget Lab estimates that Trump’s tariffs will amount to an added tax of about $270 billion per year on American businesses and consumers, costing the average household roughly $2,800 in higher prices and foregone income.\nTrump has no problem with that. He has explained away the negative impact of his tariffs by saying the\nUS economy needs “medicine\n” and that Americans can\nbuy less stuff\nif imported products get too expensive.\nBy the time Trump’s tariff regime is fully in effect, many Americans may wish that Trump had chickened out on his trade war. Higher prices and slower job growth, unfortunately, will prove that he didn’t.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for\nYahoo Finance\n.

He forgot to negotiate with his own judiciary first.\nTrump's plan to reshape worldwide trade through aggressive use of tariffs is a mess following rulings by two federal courts invalidating the rationale for many of the tariffs Trump has imposed this year. Trump has claimed numerous times that a \"national emergency,\" in the form of large and persistent US trade deficits, gives him the authority to impose virtually any tariff he wants.\nSeveral businesses and other groups sued to block those tariffs, claiming that\nTrump's use of a 1977 law to justify the tariffs is invalid\n. On May 28, a body known as the Court of International Trade\nagreed\n. The three-judge panel unanimously blocked all the tariffs Trump has imposed on an emergency basis, which is most of them. The next day, another federal judge hearing a different case\nbasically found the same thing\n.\nThe Trump administration quickly appealed, and on May 29 a federal appeals court agreed to hear the case, while also saying the Trump tariffs should remain in place until something changes. The Supreme Court is likely to be the ultimate decider, with legal analysts placing roughly 50-50 odds on whether the high court will allow or overturn the emergency tariffs. If the Supreme Court knocks them down, Trump still has several other ways of imposing tariffs.\nRead more:\nWhat Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\nEven so, Trump has clearly bungled his effort to strong-arm other nations into making trade concessions while weakening his own future leverage to strike deals. \"The damage has been done,\" James Lucier of Capital Alpha Partners explained in a May 29 analysis. \"No trade deals are likely with any country as long as an authoritative court has held not only that the basic policy is unlawful but that its implementation must be terminated immediately. Trump's credibility as a trade negotiator has been badly damaged.\"\nThere are at least four other legal avenues Trump can use to justify tariffs. Trump took the novel approach of basing his tariffs on the claim of a national emergency because it gave him maximum flexibility. Were the courts to find it legal, Trump could impose any tariff of any amount on any product at any time he chose. The whole reason Trump thinks\ntariff is \"the most beautiful word\"\nis probably that he thinks it gives him unchecked power to micromanage the economy and punish any country, company, or even individual with a custom-made tariff.\nStory Continues\nPresident Trump delivers remarks on tariffs in the Rose Garden at the White House on April 2. (Reuters/Carlos Barria/File Photo)\n·\nReuters / Reuters\nDrop Rick Newman a note\n, take his\nweekly economy quiz\n, or\nsign up for his newsletter\n.\nThe implications, however, border on ridiculous. Very few economists think a trade deficit represents anything close to a \"national emergency,\" since a trade deficit only means that Americans exchange dollars for foreign-made products they want. Before Trump started imposing tariffs, the US economy was arguably the world's most dynamic. It gets sillier still when Trump threatens tariffs on specific products, such as\nApple smartphones\n, because they're not made in the United States, as if building them overseas would let China or India control the phones Americans use.\nThe emergency justification also let Trump bypass a lot of procedural maneuvering that can take months and impose tariffs in real time. Trump recently threatened to impose a 50% tariff on products from Europe, starting June 1, for instance. The emergency justification would have allowed Trump to do that, giving the threat teeth.\nThe courts may take that leverage from Trump. A block on emergency tariffs would annul Trump's 10% \"baseline\" tariff on most imports, along with an additional 20% tariff on Chinese imports, and new Trump tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. So if the two federal bans survive appeals, Trump will not be able to impose any new tariff based on his claim of an emergency.\nStill in place are a variety of new Trump tariffs imposed under different legal justifications, including a 25% tax on imported cars and car parts, plus steel and aluminum. Trump is also reportedly working on tariffs on imported computer chips and pharmaceuticals, which wouldn't be affected by the ruling on emergency tariffs.\nIf the Supreme Court upholds the ban on emergency tariffs, Trump will, in many ways, have to start over in his quest for widespread tariffs. Other legal avenues may not allow Trump to levy something as wide-ranging as a \"baseline\" tariff on all imports from everywhere. Tariffs would have to be more targeted, with extensive documentation justifying the need, in order to survive inevitable court challenges.\nThe two rulings against the emergency tariffs may also embolden trading partners such as China and Europe that aren't eager to cave to Trump's demands on trade. Those nations are already slow-rolling Trump to some extent by playing coy while Trump contends with the damage tariffs do to his own economy back home. In several cases, Trump has backed down on his most severe tariff threats amid stock market sell-offs, rising interest rates, and other signs of stress in US markets. Traders now dub this the\n\"TACO\" trade\n, as in \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\"\nTrading partners in Trump's crosshairs now see that Trump may not even be able to persuade courts in his own country to support his tariffs. That will make them far more likely to wait for him to clear US legal wickets before they make any of the concessions Trump is after, such as making it easier to sell US products in foreign markets. The trade war will continue, but the aggressor won't be quite as fearsome.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for\nYahoo Finance\n.

In the midst of the chaos, one phrase kept surfacing across Wall Street: the \"TACO\" trade.\nAn acronym for \"Trump Always Chickens Out,\" it captures a growing belief among investors that the president talks tough on tariffs but rarely follows through. That assumption has fueled a market tailwind in recent months as traders bet on policy pivots,\nbuoyed by an initial US-China tariff deescalation earlier this month\n. ...\nStill, despite the headlines, markets had largely been leaning into the idea that Trump's tough talk rarely translates into tough action. It's a bet that's paid off: Stocks have not only erased their \"Liberation Day\" losses, but the S&P 500 (\n^GSPC\n) secured its best May since 1990 and had the best month since Nov. 2023.\nSNP - Free Realtime Quote\n•\nUSD\nS&P 500 (^GSPC)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\n5,873.66\n-38.03\n(-0.64%)\nAs of 10:07:26 AM EDT.

The Fed's goal is to get this number down to 2%.\nThe new reading was in line with expectations and cooler than the 2.7% annualized change recorded in March. Core prices also rose 0.1% in April from the prior month, in line with expectations for a 0.1% increase and the monthly increase seen in March.\nJeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, said Friday's inflation print is \"as good as it gets,\" as he expects prices to reaccelerate in the coming months.\n\"Headline inflation decelerated in April to the lowest inflation print we will likely see for the rest of the year,\" Roach added.\nThe central bank is debating internally about whether any inflation from tariffs will prove to be a one-time increase or longer-lasting.\nThe White House has argued that the Fed should view any price increases as a one-time event, with Trump himself repeatedly calling for the Fed to lower rates, but many Fed officials have made it clear they are not sure which way things will go.\nTrump\ntold Fed Chair Jerome Powell Thursday during a Thursday meeting\nthat he is making a mistake by not lowering rates, according to his press secretary, echoing the president's calls all year for the Fed to lower borrowing costs.\nThe Fed said in a statement that Powell \"did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy, except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook.\"\nRead more:\nHow much control does the president have over the Fed and interest rates?\nUS Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

But over time, excessive rate cuts would trigger a spiral of inflation.\"\nRead more:\nHow jobs, inflation, and the Fed are all related\nFederal Reserve Bank of Dallas president Lorie Logan. (Reuters/Ann Saphir/File Photo)\n·\nREUTERS / Reuters\nSome Fed policymakers are arguing for \"looking through\" the impact of the duties as temporary, but Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari said this week he believes trade talks could take \"months or years\" to resolve and that \"there could be tit-for-tat tariff increases as trading partners respond to one another.\"\nAccording to minutes released from the Fed's last policy meeting on May 6-7, almost all Fed members see the risk that inflation from tariffs could prove to be longer-lasting than expected.\nSome thought tariffs on intermediate goods — parts used to make products such as steel or aluminum — could contribute to a more persistent increase in inflation. A few thought supply chain disruptions caused by tariffs also could have longer-lasting effects on inflation, reminiscent of such effects during the pandemic.\nAt the same time, several said a number of factors could offset the uptick and persistence in inflation, including reductions in tariff increases through trade negotiations, consumers' low appetite for price increases, the potential for a weakening economy, or if firms move to increase market share rather than raise prices.\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard\nMore Info\nRecommended Stories"

The decision, which came sooner than expected, means the tariffs will remain in effect for now.\nThe US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which oversees the International Trade Court, granted the Trump administration’s request for a temporary administrative stay. This gives the court time to review legal arguments and filings. The administration must submit its briefings by June 9, after which the court will determine the next steps.\nAs Yahoo Finance legal reporter Alexis Keenan noted, Trump has broad authority to impose tariffs through various legal channels, including Sections 232 and 301. The administration had chosen to justify the tariffs under an emergency act, citing concerns such as immigration and drug trafficking — an argument the lower court rejected.\nLegal experts say it’s unclear how the appeals court will ultimately rule, as another court might interpret the emergency authority in a different way.\nThu, May 29, 2025 at 6:31 PM UTC\nAlexandra Canal\nHere's why one strategist sees Trump administration as 'bond vigilant.'\nLong-term Treasury yields have climbed\nin recent weeks\n, driven by growing concerns over the trajectory of US debt as\nPresident Trump's proposed tax legislation\nadvances to the Senate\nafter clearing the House.\nNew concerns emerged late Wednesday after a Manhattan-based trade court\nstruck down a wide swath of Trump's tariffs,\nadding to uncertainty around how the administration will manage the deficit.\n\"The tariffs the court struck down were likely to raise nearly $200 billion on an annual basis,\" Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients late Wednesday.

      "content": "Elon Musk is leaving the Trump administration after leading effort to slash federal government\nCHRIS MEGERIAN\nWed, May 28, 2025 at 10:06 PM GMT+8\n6 min read\nWASHINGTON (AP) —\nElon Musk\nis leaving his government role as a top adviser to\nPresident Donald Trump\nafter spearheading efforts to reduce and overhaul the federal bureaucracy.\nHis departure, announced Wednesday evening, marks the end of a turbulent chapter that included thousands of layoffs, the evisceration of government agencies and reams of litigation. Despite the upheaval, the billionaire entrepreneur struggled in the unfamiliar environment of Washington, and he accomplished far less than he hoped.\nHe dramatically reduced his target for cutting spending — from $2 trillion to $1 trillion to $150 billion — and increasingly expressed frustration about resistance to his goals. Sometimes he clashed with other top members of Trump's administration, who chafed at the newcomer's efforts to reshape their departments, and he faced\nfierce political blowback\nfor his efforts.\nFILE - Elon Musk flashes his T-shirt that reads \"DOGE\" to the media as he walks on the South Lawn of the White House, in Washington, March 9, 2025. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)\n·\nASSOCIATED PRESS\nMusk's role working for Trump was\nalways intended to be temporary\n, and he had recently signaled that he would be shifting his attention back to running his businesses, such as the electric automaker Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX.\nBut administration officials were often vague about when Musk would step back from his position spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, and he abruptly revealed that he was leaving in a post on X, his social media website.\n“As my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,” he wrote. “The @DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.”\nA White House official, who requested anonymity to talk about the change, confirmed Musk's departure.\nMusk announced his decision one day after CBS released\npart of an interview\nin which he criticized the centerpiece of Trump’s legislative agenda by saying he was “disappointed” by what the president calls his\n“big beautiful bill.”\nThe legislation includes a mix of tax cuts and enhanced immigration enforcement. Musk described it as a “massive spending bill” that increases the federal deficit and “undermines the work” of his Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.\n“I think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,” Musk said. “But I don’t know if it could be both.”\nTrump, speaking in the Oval Office on Wednesday, defended his agenda by talking about the delicate politics involved with negotiating the legislation.\n“I’m not happy about certain aspects of it, but I’m thrilled by other aspects of it,” he said.\nStory Continues\nTrump also suggested that more changes could be made.\n“We’re going to see what happens,” he said. “It’s got a way to go.”\nRepublicans recently pushed the measure\nthrough the House\nand are debating it\nin the Senate\n.\nMusk's concerns are shared by some Republican lawmakers. “I sympathize with Elon being discouraged,” said Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson.\nSpeaking at a Milwaukee Press Club event on Wednesday, Johnson added that he was “pretty confident” there was enough opposition “to slow this process down until the president, our leadership, gets serious” about reducing spending. He said there was no amount of pressure Trump could put on him to change his position.\nSpeaker Mike Johnson has asked senators to make as few changes to the legislation as possible, saying that House Republicans reached a “very delicate balance” that could be upended with major changes. The narrowly divided House will have to vote again on final passage once the Senate alters the bill.\nOn Wednesday, Johnson thanked Musk for his work and promised to pursue more spending cuts in the future, saying “the House is eager and ready to act on DOGE’s findings.”\nThe White House is sending some proposed rescissions, a mechanism used to cancel previously authorized spending, to Capitol Hill to solidify some of DOGE’s cuts. A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget said the package will include $1.1 billion from the Corporation of Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS, and $8.3 billion in foreign assistance.\nMusk occasionally seemed chastened by his experience working in government.\n“The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realized,” he told The Washington Post. “I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in D.C., to say the least.”\nHe also recently said that he'll\nreduce his political spending\n, because “I think I’ve done enough.”\nMusk had previously been energized by the opportunity to reshape Washington. After putting at least $250 million behind Trump's candidacy, he wore campaign hats in the White House, held his own campaign rallies, and talked about excessive spending as an existential crisis. He often tended to be effusive in his praise of Trump.\n“The more I’ve gotten to know President Trump, the more I like the guy,” Musk said in February. “Frankly, I love him.”\nTrump repaid the favor, describing Musk as “a truly great American.” When Tesla faced declining sales, he turned the White House driveway into\na makeshift showroom\nto illustrate his support.\nIt's unclear what, if any, impact that Musk's comments about the bill would have on the legislative debate, especially given his departure from the administration. During the transition period, when his influence was on the rise,\nhe helped whip up opposition\nto a spending measure as the country stood on the brink of a federal government shutdown.\nHis latest criticism could embolden Republicans who want bigger spending cuts. Republican Utah Sen. Mike Lee reposted a Fox News story about Musk's interview while also adding his own take on the measure, saying there was “still time to fix it.”\n“The Senate version will be more aggressive,” Lee said. “It can, it must, and it will be. Or it won’t pass.”\nOnly two Republicans — Reps. Warren Davidson of Ohio and Thomas Massie of Kentucky — voted against the bill when the House took up the measure last week.\nDavidson took note of Musk’s comments on social media.\n“Hopefully, the Senate will succeed with the Big Beautiful Bill where the House missed the moment,” he wrote. “Don’t hope someone else will cut deficits someday, know it has been done this Congress.”\nThe Congressional Budget Office, in a preliminary estimate, said the tax provisions would increase federal deficits by $3.8 trillion over the decade, while the\nchanges to Medicaid\n, food stamps and other services would reduce spending by slightly more than $1 trillion over the same period.\nHouse Republican leaders say increased economic growth would allow the bill to be deficit-neutral or deficit-reducing, but outside watchdogs are skeptical. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the bill would add $3 trillion to the debt, including interest, over the next decade.\n___ Associated Press writers Scott Bauer in Milwaukee, and Kevin Freking, Lisa Mascaro and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report.\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard\nMore Info\nRecommended Stories"

The expectations index surged off its 13-year low seen in April, reaching 72.8 in May, far above the 55.4 in the month prior. This marked the largest month-over-month increase for that metric\nsince May 2009.\nThe cutoff date for preliminary results was May 19, meaning any opinions swayed by\nthe US-China tariff delay\nwere likely factored in, but\nthe latest tariff back-and-forth\nwith the European Union and Apple (\nAAPL\n) wouldn't have been accounted for.\n\"This rebound is a welcome step in the right direction, but like the deal with China it may prove only a temporary reprieve until we get clearer long-term clarity on trade policy,\" Wells Fargo senior economist Tim Quinlan wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.\nRead more:\nWhat is consumer confidence, and why does it matter?\nSince the last consumer confidence report, the US and China agreed to a 90-day pause on the bulk of duties between the two countries. The development\npushed the US effective tariff rate down\nto about 14% from a prior estimate of 24%, per JPMorgan.\n\"The rebound was already visible before the May 12 US-China trade deal but gained momentum afterwards,\" Stephanie Guichard, a senior economist of global Indicators at the Conference Board, said in the release. \"The monthly improvement was largely driven by consumer expectations as all three components of the Expectations Index — business conditions, employment prospects, and future income — rose from their April lows. Consumers were less pessimistic about business conditions and job availability over the next six months and regained optimism about future income prospects.\"\nTuesday's reading marks the first major shift in a sentiment measure as consumers have digested new tariff developments. Just two weeks ago, a separate release from the University of Michigan showed\nconsumer sentiment hit its second-lowest reading on record\n. But most of those responses didn't include the latest 90-day tariff pause between the US and China.\nRead more:\nThe latest news and updates on Trump's tariffs\n\"Consumers continued to express concerns about tariffs increasing prices and having negative impacts on the economy, but some also expressed hopes that the announced and future trade deals could support economic activity,\" Guichard said.\nStory Continues\nSince the bulk of Trump's tariffs against other countries were announced on April 2, there has been a continued disconnect between most economic data and consumer sentiment. Consumers have expressed fears that tariffs will boost inflation and the current cooling in the labor market could accelerate.\nBut for now, recent inflation readings\nhave shown the pace of price increases continuing to fall\n, and\nweekly filings for unemployment benefits\nhave held steady.\nConsumer confidence rebounded in May as President Trump relaxed his aggressive stance on tariffs against China.

Economists had been expecting a more modest 1% decline. A reading of 100 is equal to the level of housing contract activity in 2001.\nYear over year, pending contracts were down 2.5% nationwide. Contract activity was down month over month in all parts of the country and decreased year over year in all regions except the Midwest, which saw a 2.2% gain.\nThe latest drop in activity comes even as homebuyers have more to choose from in most markets. According to Realtor.com, nearly 1 million homes were active on the market in April, up more than 30% from a year earlier.\nBut prices are still near all-time highs, and mortgage rates remain well above 6%, making the market unaffordable for many.\n“At this critical stage of the housing market, it is all about mortgage rates,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement. “Despite an increase in housing inventory, we are not seeing higher home sales.

That has led to increasingly hostile commentary from both sides, putting\nlast month's agreement to lower tariffs for 90 days\nin a tenuous position.\nNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett even suggested Sunday on ABC that trade negotiations with other nations are being held up by the wait for this call between Trump and Xi.\nHe explained why his previous predictions of deals have failed to materialize, saying it's because \"the trade team has been focused 100% like a laser beam on the China matter.\" Once a call resolves the China issues, he added, \"then we're going to take [other] deals into the Oval.\"\nBut it's far from unclear whether a call between the two leaders, who apparently have not spoken since before Trump's inauguration, can resolve the growing issues. The uncertainty is more pronounced by weeks of promises that a call is in the offing, with still no clarity on when it will even take place.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed hope on CBS for \"something very soon,\" while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick promised on Fox that Trump is \"going to go work it out\" without offering a timeline.\nHassett added he was hoping for a call this week, but said, \"you never know in international relations.\"\nRead more here.\nToday at 12:33 PM UTC\nJenny McCall\nEU readying 'countermeasures' if tariffs deal with US crumbles\nAP reports:\nThe European Union on Monday said it is preparing “countermeasures” against the United States after the Trump administration's surprise\ntariffs on steel\nrattled global markets and complicated the ongoing wider tariff negotiations between Brussels and Washington.\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed last week to “accelerate talks” on a deal, but that if those trade negotiations fail “then we are also prepared to accelerate our work on the defensive side,\" European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told a press conference in Brussels.\n“In the event that our negotiations do not lead to a balanced outcome, the EU is prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to this latest tariff increase,” Gill said.\nRead more here.\nToday at 12:26 PM UTC\nJenny McCall\nAluminium premium for US buyers soars after Trump doubles tariffs\nAluminium (\nALI=F\n) prices for US buyers jumped on Monday after President Trump said he planned to increase tariffs on imported steel and aluminium from 25% to 50%.\nReuters reports:\nThe US is heavily reliant on aluminium imports. About half of all aluminium used in the country for transport, packaging and construction is delivered from elsewhere, with the vast majority coming from Canada. The new tariffs are due to take effect on June 4.\nBuyers on the physical market usually pay the London Metal Exchange (LME) benchmark aluminium price plus a premium covering taxes, transport and handling costs.\nThe US Midwest duty-paid aluminium premium reached $0.58 per lb, or $1,279 a metric ton, on Monday.

In certain cases, they have had to consider changing their product strategy, looking into shifting their supply chains, reducing staff hours or delaying products.\n“My fear is, if this continues, there’s going to be like the mass extinction of small businesses,” Julie Robbins, CEO of Ohio-based guitar pedal maker EarthQuaker Devices, told CNN.\nTrump announced\nblanket tariffs across the globe on April 2\n, and since then, his plans have changed on a regular basis.\nEveAnna Manley at the Axpona Audio Expo in April. - JB/Manley Labs\nThe whiplash has been hard for companies to keep up with.

Their tickers, however, tell a more nuanced story, with the majority in the red for the year, entangled in the back-and-forth of trade policies.\nNarratives of transformative AI development and growth haven't gone unscathed. But they persist. And while there are real, costly risks from being pushed and pulled as a part of global trade deals, there's a clear path for Nvidia's problems to simply disappear.\nStory Continues\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

That has worked well in the past, but is unlikely to work well in the era of Trump tariffs.\nInvestors just got a taste of the tariff impact from computing giant HP.\nThe company missed earnings estimates by a country mile and cut guidance after the close, blaming tariff impacts.\nI just hopped off the phone with HP CEO Enrique Lores. Here are three comments from him that stood out:\n\"Tariffs announced in April were higher and impacted more countries than we were expecting, and this clearly has impacted the operating profit that we had in the quarter.\"\nNow by June, we expect almost no product coming to North America coming from China. So it's a very significant change.\"\n“We have moved production from China into Vietnam, Thailand, Mexico, some to India, and some to the US.”\n“We are exploring if it will make sense to increase our capacity [in the US], and we are doing a lot of work to see whether this will be a viable option from a cost perspective. At this point, no decisions have been made.”\nLores added that HP has been raising prices to offset the tariffs. He declined to share a percentage amount.

      "content": "What Trump's 'golden share' in US Steel has in common with his plan to 'watch' Walmart\nBen Werschkul\n·\nWashington Correspondent\nUpdated\nSat, May 31, 2025 at 6:39 AM GMT+8\n5 min read\nIn This Article:\nX\n-0.47%\nNISTF\n0.00%\nNPSCY\n+0.30%\nGM\n-3.87%\nWMT\n-0.05%\nPresident Trump has embraced a plan for Japanese-owned Nippon Steel (\nNPSCY\n) to purchase US Steel (\nX\n), largely, it seems, due to a notion that the US government will be getting a \"golden share\" as part of the bargain.\nThe president touted the merger during a rally Friday evening in West Mifflin, Pa., at a company steel processing plant where he touted a $14 billion investment from Nippon in American mills and production and promised to increase existing tariffs on steel imports to 50% from 25%.\nUS Steel will \"continue to be controlled by the USA and we are going to be working together,\" he said, and “we are going to have an amazing alliance.\" It echoed remarks he made to reporters recently when he said the deal will include Nippon making \"an investment, and it's a partial ownership, but it'll be controlled by the USA.\"\nFor now, details remain scarce, but the idea of a \"golden share\" as part of Nippon's takeover of US Steel is being touted by Trump's allies and appear set to provide the president with yet another avenue for close involvement in the inner workings of a company.\nThis coming provision is also part of a larger trend (with roots that stretch back years across Democratic and Republican administrations) that has seen Washington, D.C., move to have an increasing say in the day-to-day operations of major companies.\nAnother key front is an ongoing campaign by Trump to force Walmart (\nWMT\n) and other retailers to \"eat\" tariff price hikes, with the president promising a\npublic pressure campaign with perhaps more direct measures\nwhen it comes to those companies' individual pricing decisions.\n\"I'll be watching,\"\nhe told\nthe retailer.\nThe push by Trump for this \"golden share\" in US Steel also comes as other components of the still-to-be-finalized deal appear largely unchanged from last year, a setup that\nboth Trump (and ex-President Biden) campaigned against\n.\nSen. Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania has been involved in the talks and\nrecently sketched out a structure on CNBC\nthat included \"a US CEO, a US majority board, and then there'll be a golden share, which will essentially require US government approval of a number of the board members, and that'll allow the United States to ensure production levels aren't cut and things like that.\"\nMost of that outline — save the \"golden share\" concept — was promised by Nippon either immediately or soon after it announced its plan to buy the company in 2023.\nStory Continues\nTrump has also taken to calling the deal a \"planned partnership\" — as he did in\na social media post\non May 23 announcing his support — even as multiple reports of the deal negotiations themselves suggest Nippon is set to going ahead with its plan to purchase US Steel and make it a subsidiary of its much larger operation.\nUS Steel\nreported about $15 billion in revenue in 2024\n. Nippon's current number is about four times that.\nNYSE - Nasdaq Real Time Price\n•\nUSD\nUnited States Steel Corporation (X)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\n53.59\n-0.23\n(-0.42%)\nAs of 10:08:49 AM EDT. Market Open.\nAdvanced Chart\nWhat a 'golden share' typically entails\nTrump’s apparent blessing of the deal is a sharp reversal of his position during the campaign, where he promised to block the merger \"instantaneously.\"\nMany details of the possible setup remain unclear, such as whether Trump's golden share will give the government a literal equity stake in the combined company or simply the power to veto certain moves going forward.\nWhat also remains to be seen is how much leverage the US will have going forward in addition to levers the US currently uses to keep tabs on foreign-owned companies through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (known as CFIUS).\nThis is the agency that is tasked with reviewing foreign transactions and was involved\nwhen Biden blocked the deal earlier this year\n,\nAlso unclear is if Nippon itself is on board with Trump's plans; the company has not responded to queries on its approach to the talks.\nPresident Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office of the White House on May 28. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n·\nAndrew Harnik via Getty Images\nOther nations have historically entered into this type of \"golden share\" arrangement, which typically is a special class of shares that does confer some ownership as well as outsized voting power to block certain moves.\nThese types of arrangements are largely unheard of in recent US history with one notable exception: the 2008-2010 auto industry bailout during the Obama/Biden administration that saw the US take a stake in General Motors (\nGM\n) and Chrysler, which is now Stellantis (\nSTLA\n) North America.\nThe government didn't stay invested for long, selling the last of its stake in Chrysler in 2011 and in GM in 2013.\nThe \"golden share\" idea has also raised questions as to whether a similar concept will be included in any deal to keep TikTok operating in the US, but Trump appeared to bat down that notion recently to reporters.\n\"Nothing to do with TikTok,\"\nhe said of US Steel on Wednesday\nafter being asked about a golden share there. \"Totally different kind of deal.\"\nBeijing has nominal stakes — but Chinese law allows it outsized control — in the operations of companies like Alibaba (\nBABA\n) and, notably, TikTok's parent company, Bytedance.\nThen-President Joe Biden traveled to West Mifflin, Pennsylvania in September -- the same town Trump is visiting this week -- in part to underline his opposition to the Nippon/US Steel deal..

      "content": "What Medicare doesn't pay for becomes hefty debt for millions of seniors\nOut-of-pocket medical expenses add up quickly for people in retirement, a life stage where healthcare needs increase.\nKerry Hannon\n·\nSenior Columnist\nSat, May 31, 2025 at 10:30 PM GMT+8\n8 min read\nConnie Morton’s husband died last November. The cause: complications from Parkinson’s disease, which he had been living with for 18 years.\n“During that time, there were multiple medical costs not covered by Medicare,” the Colonial Beach, Va., resident told Yahoo Finance. “We paid what we could. For the last nine years of his life, he could no longer work. I became his caretaker, and we survived on Social Security and some help from his kids.”\nAdvertisement: High Yield Savings Offers\nEarn 4.10% APY** on balances of $5,000 or more\nView Offer\nEarn up to 4.00% APY with Savings Pods\nView Offer\nEarn up to 3.80% APY¹ & up to $300 Cash Bonus with Direct Deposit\nView Offer\nPowered by Money.com - Yahoo may earn commission from the links above.\nA growing number of retirees, like Morton, are grappling with healthcare debt due to medical bills. Medicare, which provides health insurance coverage to more than 66 million people, covers the lion’s share of the cost of medical care, but not all.\nOn average, a 65-year-old who left the workforce last year may need $165,000 in savings to cover out-of-pocket healthcare expenses throughout retirement.\nEarlier this year, Morton broke her ankle. “That also added up to significant hospital bills,” she said.\nThe combination of medical bills not covered by Medicare for the retired couple: roughly $90,000.\n“I'm at a point now where I can't keep my house because the bills are much too high,” Morton said. “I'm trying to decide what I'm going to do.”\nFive-figure medical debt\nOne in 10 people age 65 or older with healthcare debt owe $10,000 or more, according to a\nKFF study\n.\n“That is a shocking number,” said Tricia Neuman, senior vice president of KFF. “Some of it is credit card debt, some of it is just debt owed to a healthcare provider or a hospital. Some of it is debt to other family members.”\nConsider that half of all people on Medicare live on about $35,000 or less, Neuman added. “So a $10,000 bill, or $10,000 worth of medical debt, can really be unaffordable for people and have serious consequences.”\nThe bills that lead to the debt typically include routine healthcare services such as lab fees and diagnostic tests, dental care, and visits to the doctor, and long-term care services not covered by Medicare, according to KFF. Medicare often requires patients to pay out of pocket around\n20% of their doctor bills.\n“In-home care for people who are unable to take care of themselves and don't have family members that can drop everything to be there 24/7, is particularly big,” she added. “It's a variety of healthcare expenses that can pile up and lead to medical debt.”\nThe credit card debt domino\nOne of the biggest culprits of\ncredit card debt\nis out-of-pocket medical costs. The amount that people borrow increases dramatically with age. Half of adults 50 and older who report borrowing money to pay for healthcare in the past 12 months borrowed approximately $3,000 or more, according to a new\nWest Health-Gallup healthcare survey\n. In contrast, the median amount was $750 for adults aged 30-49 and $300 for young adults aged 18-29.\nStory Continues\n“People often have higher healthcare expenses as they age, for things like dental, vision care, prescription medication, and doctor visits,” said Lori Trawinski, AARP’s senior director of finance and employment.\n“In many cases, healthcare costs are often charged on credit cards, which can lead to carrying that debt from month to month,” she said.\nThat’s real trouble. Anyone who has rolled over credit card balances is keenly aware of the debt that accrues when you can only pay the minimum on credit cards with interest rates topping 20%.\nTroubling, too, is that many people on Medicare say that they or another member of their household have delayed, skipped, or sought alternatives to needed healthcare or prescription medications due to costs, KFF found.\nRead more:\nThe best ways to pay off credit card debt\nMany retirees are 'unprepared for a medical shock'\nAnqi Chen, co-author of a\nbrief from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College\n, recently surveyed retirees with $100,000 in investable assets.\n“They were largely unprepared for a medical shock,” she learned.\nOne driver is that traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage do not cover the cost of long-term care in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities.\nAn apartment in an assisted-living facility had an average rate of $74,148 a year in 2024, according to\nthe National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care\n— and costs go up as residents age and need more care. Units for dementia patients can run more than $94,000.\n“If these shocks are big enough, they can devastate a household’s finances,” Chen said. “About 80% of those ages 65 and over will require some long-term care, with nearly 20% requiring high-intensity care for more than three years.”\nHave a question about retirement?

If you have a limited income, you might be eligible for\nMedicare’s Extra Help\n, which covers Part D premiums and deductibles and caps drug costs.\nAnd for now, free\none-on-one counseling\nis available through state Health Insurance Assistance Programs.\nRead more:\nWhat is an emergency savings fund?\nDon’t be shy\nIf you’re having issues affording your care, ask your doctor if there is anything more cost-effective, such as changing medications or going to other facilities for testing, McClanahan said.\n“And make sure you understand why your doctor is ordering tests and what they plan to do with the information. Sometimes they order tests based on ‘protocol’ and aren’t really needed,” she added.\nConsult a financial adviser\nIf you have a health shock, your financial adviser can help with a plan by reviewing your overall assets, cash flow, liquidity, and where you can rebalance investments to free up cash to cover future bills.\nSign up for the Mind Your Money weekly newsletter\nSubscribe\nBy subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nBuild a health savings account (HSA)\nIf you’re retiring soon, maximizing\nHSA contributions\ncan be a smart move. An HSA lets you put money in on a tax-free basis, lets that money build up tax-free, and lets it come out tax-free for qualified healthcare expenses. (Some states assess state taxes.)\nIn order to put money into an HSA, you must be enrolled in a high-deductible health plan. In those plans, you pay a lower premium per month than other types of health insurance plans, but a heftier annual deductible.\nRead more:\nHSA contribution limits for 2025: Here’s how much you can save\nCheck your credit report\nGet a free copy of your credit reports from\nAnnualcreditreport.com\n.\nIn January, the\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) finalized a rule\nthat bans the inclusion of medical bills on credit reports used by lenders and prohibits lenders from using medical information in their lending decisions\nEach of the three big credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and Transunion — provides these free once a year.

It might be possible to set up a low-interest payment plan with the hospital or medical provider. Credit card issuers might also lower your interest rate if you have a good track record of timely payments before the medical crisis.\nTap retirement accounts\nIf you’re over 59½, you can pull from your tax-deferred accounts penalty-free, although you will pay tax on the amount you withdraw.\nFor many people, this is a speedy way to eliminate debt. However, it comes with a red-light caveat: Using your retirement accounts to whittle down debt depletes your retirement savings, and you miss out on the possibility of returns on those invested dollars.\nWork with a counselor\nA nonprofit credit counselor may also be able to negotiate with your credit card issuers if your medical debt is part of a credit card balance. You will pay a fee for the service. The Justice Department website provides\na list\nof approved credit counseling agencies.

But if there’s no relief in sight for your medical debt, this can be a do-over. A bankruptcy attorney can walk through the details with you.\nIn general, retirement accounts are off the table during bankruptcies under federal law. Pensions, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, SEP-IRAs, and qualified profit-sharing plans are exempt from creditors.\nTraditional and Roth individual retirement accounts worth up to roughly $1.7 million are also protected.

That has led to increasingly hostile commentary from both sides, putting\nlast month's agreement to lower tariffs for 90 days\nin a tenuous position.\nNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett even suggested Sunday on ABC that trade negotiations with other nations are being held up by the wait for this call between Trump and Xi.\nHe explained why his previous predictions of deals have failed to materialize, saying it's because \"the trade team has been focused 100% like a laser beam on the China matter.\" Once a call resolves the China issues, he added, \"then we're going to take [other] deals into the Oval.\"\nBut it's far from unclear whether a call between the two leaders, who apparently have not spoken since before Trump's inauguration, can resolve the growing issues. The uncertainty is more pronounced by weeks of promises that a call is in the offing, with still no clarity on when it will even take place.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed hope on CBS for \"something very soon,\" while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick promised on Fox that Trump is \"going to go work it out\" without offering a timeline.\nHassett added he was hoping for a call this week, but said, \"you never know in international relations.\"\nRead more here.\nToday at 12:33 PM UTC\nJenny McCall\nEU readying 'countermeasures' if tariffs deal with US crumbles\nAP reports:\nThe European Union on Monday said it is preparing “countermeasures” against the United States after the Trump administration's surprise\ntariffs on steel\nrattled global markets and complicated the ongoing wider tariff negotiations between Brussels and Washington.\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed last week to “accelerate talks” on a deal, but that if those trade negotiations fail “then we are also prepared to accelerate our work on the defensive side,\" European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told a press conference in Brussels.\n“In the event that our negotiations do not lead to a balanced outcome, the EU is prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to this latest tariff increase,” Gill said.\nRead more here.\nToday at 12:26 PM UTC\nJenny McCall\nAluminium premium for US buyers soars after Trump doubles tariffs\nAluminium (\nALI=F\n) prices for US buyers jumped on Monday after President Trump said he planned to increase tariffs on imported steel and aluminium from 25% to 50%.\nReuters reports:\nThe US is heavily reliant on aluminium imports.

That blocked the Environmental Protection Agency from setting deep limits on power-plant pollution and the Education Department from slashing student loans for 40 million people.\nThe concept — known as the “major questions doctrine” — is now playing a central role in the case against Trump’s unilateral imposition of worldwide import taxes. With Supreme Court review all but inevitable, the justices’ willingness to employ the doctrine against Trump may determine the fate of his signature economic initiative.\nRead more here\nSat, May 31, 2025 at 7:25 PM UTC\nTrump tariffs push friendly relationship between Detroit and Windsor to the brink of a breakup\nThe Financial Times reports that the strain of President Donald Trump's tariffs has taken its toll on the friendly cross-border relationship between Windsor, Ontario and Detroit, Michigan:\nTariffs, and the associated uncertainty, have undermined the region’s prosperity and frayed ties that government, business and labor leaders describe using words such as “family” and “best friends”.\n“It’s a border that exists, but it’s not anything that culturally has ever been an issue,” said Ryan Donally, chief executive of the Windsor Essex Chamber of Commerce. “So for this trade war . . . to start breaking down the social fabric between Detroit and Windsor, it’s even more hurtful, because quite frankly, it’s not just business.

Tesla's long-range Model Y and Model 3 vehicles contain 87.5% \"total domestic content,\" according to a\n2024 study by Kelley Blue Book\n.\n\"It used to bother me, [automakers] make a part in Canada, a part in Mexico, a part in Europe, and sent all over the place, and nobody knew what the hell was happening,\" Trump continued. \"I think you build a car, make it in America. ... over the next year, they've got to have the whole thing built in America.\"\nThe US imposed\nauto tariffs of 25%\non May 3, but the Trump administration carved out an exemption for some auto parts tariffs, stating that they would not be stacked on top of other tariffs.

GameStop (\nGME\n) invited more volatility to its doorstep and provided an early answer.\nAfter\nannouncing the purchase\nof more than 4,700 bitcoins, the stock sank as the video game retailer-turned-YOLO ticker underwent a new transformation into a digital currency \"hodler.\"\nThere's a reaction\nto the announcement\n, perhaps expected and even warranted, that this is the latest flailing attempt to turn a business in decline into something people will like better. Why not lean into GameStop's own recent history as a meme stock and take it to its logical crypto conclusion?\nAfter all, there's a successful precedent on its side, with huge gains to boot: Michael Saylor's bitcoin-holding company, Strategy (\nMSTR\n).\nShares of Strategy, which has dubbed itself the world’s first bitcoin treasury company, have more than doubled over the past year. Cocksure, unswerving, and devilishly simple at first glance, Strategy's... strategy is to amass bitcoin and\nride the appreciation to the moon\n.\nWhen the price of bitcoin tumbles, investors have to brace for impact. But over a recent stretch of wins, the success of bolstering balance sheets with crypto has increasingly become a go-to corporate finance maneuver.\nBut instead of igniting a rally for GameStop, investors initially responded by looking for the exits. And with good reason: Strategy is a unique company with unique advantages, not a playbook.\nCCC - CoinMarketCap\n•\nUSD\nBitcoin USD (BTC-USD)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\n103,915.30\n-648.44\n(-0.62%)\nAs of 2:07:00 PM UTC. Market Open.\nBTC-USD\nGME\nMSTR\nAdvanced Chart\nThe important differences between Strategy and its imitators start with Saylor himself, an old bitcoin hand, not a bandwagoner. Investors, so far, trust him to steer the ship through unpredictable, often turbulent currents. And by using clever financial engineering to sell new shares and debt while promising to keep buying and holding bitcoin, his backers envision a kind of \"\nperpetual-motion money machine\n.\"\nAnother key difference: This project was started back when it was hard to buy bitcoin without also taking on tricky custodial duties, dealing with \"cold storage,\" security concerns, and the perpetual worry of accidentally ending up with thousands trapped on a locked laptop if you're not quite as good with computers as you thought you were.\nIt helps too that Strategy is the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, reinforcing the accumulation engine, and that Saylor's vocal advocacy for bitcoin\nbolsters a story of daring conviction\n, not unlike the retail speculation that fueled GameStop's wild saga.\nStory Continues\nThe clearest sign of success is the dumbfounding math of the company's holdings:\nRecent disclosures\nshow Strategy owns more than $60 billion worth of bitcoin at current market prices. But the company's market cap stands at roughly $101 billion.\nPerhaps the real winner in GameStop's move —\nand Trump Media's bitcoin acquisition\n— is, in fact, Strategy itself, which yet again sees its strategy validated by the sincerest form of flattery. As my colleague\nInes Ferré\nreports, dozens of corporations have added bitcoin to their treasuries, amounting to more than 3% of the global supply.\nGameStop has had dreams of becoming the next\nBerkshire Hathaway\n(\nBRK-A\n,\nBRK-B\n). But if it manages to become the next Strategy, that'd be a resounding success.\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

      "content": "Aston Martin faces pressure from Fitch\nMotor Finance\n·\nShutterstock\nAlejandro Gonzalez\nMon, June 2, 2025 at 9:56 PM GMT+8\n3 min read\nIn This Article:\nARGGY\n+1.13%\nFitch Ratings has maintained Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings Plc’s long-term issuer default rating at ‘B-’, with a\nNegative Outlook\n, citing increased liquidity risk and weaker-than-expected free cash flow in 2024. The credit update, published on 2 June, follows continued financial pressure on the luxury carmaker, despite a recent capital injection and relief from proposed US automotive tariffs.\nThe rating action comes two months after Aston Martin’s executive chairman Lawrence Stroll told\nBloomberg News\n(1 April) that he does not rule out taking the company private. Stroll described the carmaker’s market valuation — around £650 million — as a “joke”, noting it is now roughly equal to the amount his Yew Tree consortium has invested since 2020. After the latest £52.5 million capital raise, Yew Tree's stake will increase to around 33%.\nWhile Stroll insists the company is “severely undervalued”, Fitch’s view underscores the difficulty of turning around the carmaker’s financial performance. Fitch highlighted a larger-than-anticipated free cash flow deficit in 2024 and ongoing execution risks linked to Aston Martin’s turnaround strategy. These concerns persist despite a £125 million capital boost announced at the end of March, comprising a share issue and the sale of the company’s stake in its Formula 1 team, which temporarily eases liquidity pressures.\nAston Martin, which has declared its goal to become EBIT-profitable in 2025, has consistently struggled to achieve sustainable performance. Car sales fell 9% year-on-year to around 6,000 in 2024, while the group reported a pre-tax loss of £290 million. Analysts have questioned the company's ability to deliver on revised profitability targets, particularly given ongoing supply chain constraints and past delays in model launches.\nThe company’s US exposure adds further complexity. The US accounted for 37% of group revenue in 2024, and earlier proposals from the Trump administration to impose 25% tariffs on UK car imports raised concerns.\nHowever, a new UK–US trade agreement, whose implementation date remains unclear, will reduce duties to 10% for the first 100,000 vehicles exported annually, roughly equivalent to the UK's 2024 export total, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). While management has downplayed the impact, noting the tariff hike is “not catastrophic,” Fitch notes that the pricing implications are uncertain.\nTo mitigate near-term tariff effects, Aston Martin accelerated US-bound shipments in Q1 2025, providing inventory cover for the second quarter. Management has also indicated that passing on higher costs may be feasible for high-margin, limited-run models, but Fitch notes that long-term margin effects remain unclear. Tariff-related cost pressure adds to existing inflationary challenges, though the company continues to pursue cost-saving initiatives.\nStory Continues\nSince its 2018 IPO at a £4.3 billion valuation, Aston Martin has undergone several strategic resets. The latest, under new CEO Adrian Hallmark, who joined from Bentley Motors Ltd, prioritises profit over volume, scrapping previous sales targets and focusing instead on customised, high-margin models and derivatives of existing platforms. Hallmark previously led Bentley to record profitability, increasing its operating margins to over 20% by 2023.\nStill, Fitch warns that Aston Martin’s “rating headroom remains constrained,” with profitability dependent on effective execution, shareholder support, and resilience to external risks including weaker demand, particularly in China, and potential delays to new launches.\n\"Aston Martin faces pressure from Fitch\" was originally created and published by\nMotor Finance Online\n, a GlobalData owned brand.\nThe information on this site has been included in good faith for general informational purposes only.

AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate. Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure — just like electricity and the internet — and NVIDIA stands at the center of this profound transformation.\nWed, May 28, 2025 at 8:23 PM UTC\nMyles Udland\nNvidia earnings Wall Street forecasts as China export controls shift results\nNvidia's first quarter results on Wednesday came in a bit shy of Wall Street estimates, with adjusted earnings per share and revenue in its data center business falling short of expectations.\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia earned $0.96 per share on an adjusted basis, which excludes charges related to export controls and associated tax implications, with headline revenue coming in at $44.1 billion. Diluted earnings per share came in at $0.81.\nWall Street expected the company to report adjusted earnings per share of $0.88 on revenue of $43.3 billion, according to estimates from Bloomberg. A year ago, Nvidia reported adjusted EPS of $0.61 on revenue of $26 billion.\nNvidia's data center business — which captures spending on its AI chips — tallied revenue of $39.1 billion, just below the $39.22 billion forecasted by the Street.\nShares of the company were up about 3% in extended trading in immediate reaction to the numbers.\nWed, May 28, 2025 at 6:31 PM UTC\nGrace O'Donnell\nThe pros and cons of investing in Nvidia heading into earnings\nNvidia (\nNVDA\n) stock has rallied hard in May, gaining 24% in the past month.\nThat leaves many investors wondering if it's a good time to pile into the stock ahead of the chip giant's earnings report. We've pointed out here that\nNvidia stock tends to swing 7%\nin either direction the day after it reports. My colleague Laura Bratton has also noted that\nNvidia's earnings often surprise Wall Street\n.\nAccording to tastylive founder and CEO Tom Sosnoff, volatility in the stock is low, even heading into earnings, suggesting that \"the expectations are for something rangebound to happen.\"\nSosnoff outlined several key points investors should keep in mind when determining whether to invest in a popular name like Nvidia:\nPros:\n\"It’s super liquid,\" Sosnoff said on\nWealth\n. \"It's got a very liquid derivatives marketplace. So you can do lots of different strategies and things like that.\"\nSosnoff also pointed out that Nvidia remains a market leader. \"It’s the bluest of all blue chips right now,\" he said.\nCons:\nA major con, according to Sosnoff, is that \"it’s a crowded trade. Nvidia is pretty fully priced.\"\nHe added that \"for the first time, we're not seeing any call skew in there, which means that the derivatives markets, which are pretty good at pricing upside expectations, are kind of mixed right now. They're saying, 'you know what, upside and downside, we have similar expectations.'\"\n\"So I think the con is that if Nvidia misses, there’s pretty decent pot odds that the downside move could be greater than the upside move if they hit it,\" he explained.\nWed, May 28, 2025 at 4:00 PM UTC\nGrace O'Donnell\nChart: How Nvidia ran away from the competition\nYahoo Finance's Josh Schafer highlighted one chart that shows how Nvidia became the dominant chipmaker and one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalization of over $3 trillion:\nThere's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.2 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's (\nINTC\n) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' (\nAMD\n) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.\nCheck out more charts like this that show Nvidia's rise\n.\nWed, May 28, 2025 at 3:12 PM UTC\nGrace O'Donnell\nNvidia earnings topped forecasts by 10% over past 2 years, double the S&P 500 average\nYahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports:\nNvidia's (\nNVDA\n) earnings and revenue beat Wall Street's expectations nearly every quarter over the past two years.\nOver the past eight quarters, Nvidia's earnings per share exceeded Wall Street's projections by an average of 9.8%. Over that same time frame, Nvidia's quarterly revenue beat the Street by an average of 8.9%.\nMeanwhile, S&P 500 companies reported earnings and sales roughly 5% and 1.3% above Wall Street's expectations in that time frame, according to Bloomberg data.\nOnly once in that period — during the second quarter of its fiscal year 2025 — did Nvidia's earnings miss forecasts. Its revenue has exceeded forecasts during each of the past eight quarters.\n\"We expect largely inline results and outlook despite the negative top-line impact related to recently disclosed H20 restrictions,\" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy wrote in a May 22 note to investors, citing \"demand for H200, coupled with initial GB200 ramps.\"\nRead more here.\nWed, May 28, 2025 at 2:29 PM UTC\nGrace O'Donnell\n3 things Nvidia investors should look out for in its earnings call\nThe countdown to Nvidia's earnings has begun.\nBeyond the top and bottom line figures, which Wall Street expects to be solid, Yahoo Finance's\nBrian Sozzi\nand\nBrooke Sweeney\nhave compiled three things that investors should watch out for:\n1. Pay close attention to comments about AI demand and data center growth\nNvidia's data center segment, driven by AI chips like the H100 and its Blackwell platform, accounts for the lion's share of its revenue. Analysts will be listening for signals about cloud providers and hyperscalers like Amazon (\nAMZN\n), Microsoft (\nMSFT\n), and Google (\nGOOG\n).\nAre they still placing large orders? Are there any hints of softening demand or delayed deployments? If so, that could rattle investor confidence in the AI infrastructure build-out and Nvidia's future.\n2. Keep an eye on comments about Nvidia's gross profit margins, which are under pressure\nNvidia has been benefiting from premium pricing on its high-performance chips. But with increasing competition from AMD (\nAMD\n) and custom silicon efforts from Big Tech companies, margins may come under more pressure. Investors will want to know if Nvidia is maintaining its pricing power or if it's beginning to feel cost compression, especially as it prepares for the high-volume rollout of Blackwell chips.\n3. It's all about guidance\nInvestors want to know whether demand is still accelerating or beginning to plateau. Any hint of slowing revenue or capital expenditures from key customers could prompt a reassessment of Nvidia's valuation. On the flip side, a bullish forecast — especially tied to Blackwell adoption or new enterprise use cases — could reignite momentum.\nAlso listen for updates on supply chain capacity, chip-launch timelines, and geopolitical risks.\nRead more here.\nWed, May 28, 2025 at 2:05 PM UTC\nGrace O'Donnell\nNvidia stock wavers in early trading ahead of earnings\nNvidia stock (\nNVDA\n) opened modestly higher ahead of its earnings report but fluctuated in early trading.

Its stock price is down 19% on the year, it's facing a Department of Justice (DOJ) antitrust probe, and it continues to face off with Epic Games over App Store purchases.\nThe company delayed its improved Siri until later this year and is still trying to catch up to competitors like Google (\nGOOG\n,\nGOOGL\n) and Samsung on the AI front. And last week, former Apple design chief Jony Ive announced he's working on a new consumer product with Sam Altman and OpenAI (\nOPAI.PVT\n). To top it all off, President Trump is now coming for the company's most important product: the iPhone.\nTrump fired off a missive on his Truth Social account last week demanding that Apple build its iPhones in the US or face a 25% tariff. He later said the same terms apply to Apple rival Samsung.\n\"The combination of all these factors is arguably the biggest test, I think, Apple has seen in a very long time,\" TECHnalysis Research founder and chief analyst Bob O'Donnell told Yahoo Finance.\n\"It's creating a series of question marks around a company that ... never really faced serious question marks for a long time.\"\nApple CEO Tim Cook, center, stands behind President Trump and Vice President Vance after the two were sworn into office at an inauguration ceremony in the rotunda of the US Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 20, 2025. (Shawn Thew/Pool via Reuters)\n·\nvia REUTERS / Reuters\nThe only person who can answer those questions is CEO Tim Cook. While he has navigated crises in the past, including COVID-induced supply chain crunches, the cavalcade of issues piling up for the iPhone maker will prove to be Cook's biggest challenge yet.\nTrump's iPhone threats\nApple's most pressing threat comes in the form of Trump's threat to hit Apple's iPhone with a 25% tariff if Cook doesn't move production to the US.\n\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's [sic] that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" Trump wrote in a\nMay 23 Truth Social post\n. \"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S.\"\nApple largely avoided Trump's initial round of \"Liberation Day\" tariffs and subsequent increased levies on goods from China by shifting production of iPhones and other hardware to India, Vietnam, and other regions.\nDuring the company's second quarter earnings call, Cook said the majority of US-bound iPhones in the current quarter will come from India, and almost all iPads, Macs, Apple Watches, and AirPods will come from Vietnam. Though he added that Apple would still take a\n$900 million hit from tariffs in the current quarter\n.\nPresident Trump threatened 25% tariffs on Apple's iPhones. (Image: Truth Social)\n·\nTruth Social\nBuilding an iPhone in the US would not only require a Herculean effort to pull off during Trump's term but also add hundreds of dollars to iPhone prices.\nStory Continues\n\"The reality of Apple being able to do any manufacturing of iPhones in the US is extraordinarily unlikely. And even if they made their best efforts ... it's like a five- to 10-year thing,” O'Donnell said.\n\"By the time they would want to move that kind of manufacturing to the US, it's all going to end up being roboticized,\" he added. \"So it's just going to be robots in the US as opposed to people. It’s not like it's going to create all these huge numbers of jobs.\"\nAccording to Morgan Stanley Research's Sharon Shih, an iPhone built in the US would likely cost 35% more than one built in China or India due to tariffs on iPhone components from China and the higher cost of labor in the US. That would send the cost of an iPhone 16 Pro from $999 to $1,350.\nHowever, if Apple decides to accept the 25% tariff as is, Morgan Stanley's Erik Woodring estimates the company would only need to increase global iPhone prices by 4% to 6%.\nRead more:\nWhat Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\nAI and Jony Ive\nBut Trump's tariff threat is a transitory issue that could change at any given time. Apple's bigger problem is its slow start in the AI competition. The company rolled out its Apple Intelligence platform in Oct. 2024, well after Google and Microsoft (\nMSFT\n) debuted their own AI services, and delayed the release of its enhanced version of Siri until later this year.\nOn top of that, Apple faces the prospect of a new consumer electronics challenger in the form of Ive and Altman's\nAI-centric\ndevice.\nApple CEO Tim Cook, left, and chief design officer Jonathan Ive look at the Mac Pro in the display room at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, Calif, in June 2019. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)\n·\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\"The piece that, if I'm Tim Cook, that keeps me up at night is the question around AI,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\"And I think that the Ive announcement underscores that there are deep wallets predicting a seismic change in terms of how businesses and consumers use tech. And the force of that change, AI, is something that Apple has struggled with.\"\nApple has the opportunity to change the narrative around its AI offerings during its WWDC developer event on June 9. Apple is expected to show off the latest versions of its various operating systems, including iOS 19 and iPadOS 19, as well as the next iteration of its macOS.\nApple will also need to provide more information on when consumers can expect to get their hands on the latest version of Siri and ensure the software has been worth the wait.\nThe DOJ and Epic\nLurking in the background of all of this are Apple's ongoing legal battles with the Department of Justice and \"Fortnite\" developer Epic Games. The Justice Department filed its antitrust suit against Apple in March 2024, arguing that the company\nmaintains an illegal monopoly\nover the smartphone market.\nAccording to the antitrust suit, Apple harms consumers by making it more difficult for iPhone users to switch to competing products and to access competing services. The complaint also says Apple harms app developers by imposing restrictions on app creation and distribution.\nA loss in the case could force Apple to open up its walled garden of apps and services, making it easier for users to access third-party hardware and services.\nApple is also wrapped up in the DOJ's antitrust case against Google's search dominance. That case, which Google lost, revolves around Google's various deals to keep its search empire ahead of the competition, including\na $20 billion per year agreement\nwith Apple that makes Google the default search engine on iPhones, Macs, and other devices.\nIf Google is forced to ditch that deal, it would put a significant dent in Apple's services business revenue.\nApple also continues to contend with the fallout from its antitrust legal fight with Epic Games, which found that while Apple wasn't violating antitrust laws, it had to provide app developers with a means of pointing customers to options to make app purchases outside of Apple's App Store, avoiding the company's app store fees.\nBut according to US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, Apple didn't do that. Instead, it began charging developers a new fee for purchases customers made in their apps outside of the App Store. Gonzalez Rogers is asking prosecutors to look into\nApple's moves to review the alleged \"cover-up.\"\nIt all adds up to a harrowing 2025 for Apple. And there's still plenty of the year left to go.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\n·\nyahoofinance\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

But with the Trump bill projected to add\n$4 trillion\nto the national debt over the next decade, fiscal risk has become a key driver of long-term rates.\nThe legislation proposes sweeping cuts to individual and corporate tax rates but offers little in the way of meaningful spending reductions, deepening investor concerns over the US's\nalready fragile fiscal situation.\n\"There's no evidence of fiscal restraint,\" Winograd said. \"If anything, we're seeing additional fiscal deterioration.\"\nThe bill, which cleared the House last week, is now headed to the Senate, where lawmakers could make significant changes to its provisions.

So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\" Trump wrote. Later in the Oval Office, he hinted he planned to speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\nThe escalation comes as the US-China detente — reached earlier this month, when each country eased sky-high tariffs on the other —\nlooks more fragile\namid both trade-related and other tensions.\nMeanwhile, Trump\nsaid\nat a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday that he is going to double tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50%.\nThe hike, the president said, \"will even further secure the steel industry in the United States.\"\nTrump's most sweeping tariffs face legal uncertainty after a federal appeals court allowed the tariffs to temporarily stay in effect, a day after the US Court of International Trade\nblocked their implementation\n, deeming the method used to enact them \"unlawful.\"\nThat means Trump's tariff agenda remains intact, if in flux, in the latest twist in the unfolding legal saga that Trump said Friday he was confident he would \"win.\"\nThe White House has vowed to take its appeal to the Supreme Court if necessary.\nAdministration officials also hinted that court rulings would not be the final say.\nYahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul has an overview\nof the other maneuvers Trump could pursue.\nHere are the latest updates as the policy reverberates around the world.\nLIVE\n1045 updates\nFeatured\nToday at 8:05 AM UTC\nJenny McCall\nChina accuses US of violating trade deal, vows firm response\nChina has hit back at President Trump,\naccusing the US\nof violating their recent trade agreement, making it less likely that Trump will get the leadership call he wants to restart trade talks between the two sides.\nOn Monday, the Chinese Ministry\nof Commerce said in a statement that the US had introduced discriminatory restrictions, including new guidelines on AI chip export controls, curbs on chip design software sales to China, and the withdrawal of Chinese student visas.

That has led to increasingly hostile commentary from both sides, putting\nlast month's agreement to lower tariffs for 90 days\nin a tenuous position.\nNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett even suggested Sunday on ABC that trade negotiations with other nations are being held up by the wait for this call between Trump and Xi.\nHe explained why his previous predictions of deals have failed to materialize, saying it's because \"the trade team has been focused 100% like a laser beam on the China matter.\" Once a call resolves the China issues, he added, \"then we're going to take [other] deals into the Oval.\"\nBut it's far from unclear whether a call between the two leaders, who apparently have not spoken since before Trump's inauguration, can resolve the growing issues. The uncertainty is more pronounced by weeks of promises that a call is in the offing, with still no clarity on when it will even take place.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed hope on CBS for \"something very soon,\" while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick promised on Fox that Trump is \"going to go work it out\" without offering a timeline.\nHassett added he was hoping for a call this week, but said, \"you never know in international relations.\"\nRead more here.\nToday at 12:33 PM UTC\nJenny McCall\nEU readying 'countermeasures' if tariffs deal with US crumbles\nAP reports:\nThe European Union on Monday said it is preparing “countermeasures” against the United States after the Trump administration's surprise\ntariffs on steel\nrattled global markets and complicated the ongoing wider tariff negotiations between Brussels and Washington.\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed last week to “accelerate talks” on a deal, but that if those trade negotiations fail “then we are also prepared to accelerate our work on the defensive side,\" European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told a press conference in Brussels.\n“In the event that our negotiations do not lead to a balanced outcome, the EU is prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to this latest tariff increase,” Gill said.\nRead more here.\nToday at 12:26 PM UTC\nJenny McCall\nAluminium premium for US buyers soars after Trump doubles tariffs\nAluminium (\nALI=F\n) prices for US buyers jumped on Monday after President Trump said he planned to increase tariffs on imported steel and aluminium from 25% to 50%.\nReuters reports:\nThe US is heavily reliant on aluminium imports. About half of all aluminium used in the country for transport, packaging and construction is delivered from elsewhere, with the vast majority coming from Canada. The new tariffs are due to take effect on June 4.\nBuyers on the physical market usually pay the London Metal Exchange (LME) benchmark aluminium price plus a premium covering taxes, transport and handling costs.\nThe US Midwest duty-paid aluminium premium reached $0.58 per lb, or $1,279 a metric ton, on Monday.

The company also said it expects to miss out on roughly $8 billion in sales of H20s in the second quarter.\nNvidia stock was up 5% in premarket trading on Thursday following the announcement.\nNasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price\n•\nUSD\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\n136.37\n+1.24\n+(0.93%)\nAs of 10:09:53 AM EDT.

Without the charge for the H20 chips in Q1, adjusted EPS would have topped out at $0.96.\nThe company reported adjusted EPS of $0.61 on revenue of $26 billion in the same period last year.\nNvidia's data center segment, its largest business, saw revenue of $39.1 billion, up from $22.5 billion last year but behind Wall Street expectations of $39.2 billion.\nAccording to Nvidia CFO Colette Kress, Nvidia generated just under 50% of its data center revenue via hyperscalers like Amazon (\nAMZN\n), Google (\nGOOG\n), and Microsoft (\nMSFT\n).\n\"Global demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure is incredibly strong,\" CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.\n\"AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate. Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure — just like electricity and the internet — and Nvidia stands at the center of this profound transformation,” he said.\nNvidia had to write down $4.5 billion in charges related to the Trump administration's ban on sales of its H20 chip to China. The company announced the news\nin an April regulatory filing\n.\nNvidia's shares have fluctuated wildly since the start of the year as the company has dealt with setbacks ranging from export controls to concerns related to expected semiconductor tariffs.\nBut a last-minute reprieve from Washington's planned AI diffusion rule, which was put in place by the Biden administration to limit GPU sales to certain countries, and major investment announcements during Trump's visit to the Middle East have increased Nvidia's share price to more than $136 — slightly less than 2% up from the stock's value at the start of the year, and up roughly 20% over the past 12 months as of Wednesday.\nNvidia's report follows the company's showing at the annual Computex Taipei trade show in Taiwan, where it showcased new technologies, such as a cloud offering that gives customers access to cloud-based versions of Nvidia's GPUs via third-party providers like CoreWeave (\nCRWV\n) and Foxconn (\n2354.TW\n).\nStory Continues\nNvidia specifically designed the H20 to meet the Biden administration's restrictions on AI chips destined for China. But DeepSeek sent shockwaves through Washington and Wall Street when it proved it could produce powerful AI models using below top-of-the-line Nvidia chips. As a result, Trump imposed tighter restrictions on the company's chips, banning the sale of H20s in the country.\n\"There is simply no offset to this,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore wrote in an investor note ahead of the earnings report.\n\"Blackwell demand is very strong ... but they are supply constrained, and lost H20 does not result in more Blackwell supply. We assume that this takes about $1 billion out of the April [quarter] — impact was effective April 7, so 23 days of lost H20 revenue—and about $5 billion of lost revenue in July. We actually think demand for H20 is much higher, driven by the surge of inference in China.\"\nAccording to Reuters\n, Nvidia is now working on a modified version of the H20 that meets the Trump administration's performance requirements.\nDuring a press conference at Computex, Huang came out swinging against the US's policies, saying that they've been a failure and that they benefit China's own AI chipmakers,\naccording to Bloomberg\n.\nNvidia received relief from some export restrictions when the Trump administration axed the Biden administration's planned AI diffusion rules, which would have created a tiered system that determined which countries could purchase AI chips and which required special licenses or couldn't get them at all.

A massive deposit of more than $16.5 billion appeared in government coffers on May 22.\nMay's total so far has already topped April's full-month haul of $17.4 billion — not to mention March's haul of $9.6 billion.\nIt was a continuation of revenue spikes seen during Trump's second term in office, which dwarfed recent history and Trump's first term.\nAll told, more than $92 billion has flowed into government coffers since Jan. 1.\nMay's surge in revenue came as many of Trump's duties were only felt for an entire month after his biggest tariffs — 10% duties on nearly every country in the world — took effect on April 5.\nThe haul also came after other new concessions from Trump this month that saw\na slashing of tariffs on China\nand a\nlimited lowering of duties on the UK\n.\nTrump added Tuesday\nin a social media post\nthat more duties could be coming, saying\nof his decision to delay 50% tariffs on Europe for now\n, \"Remember, I am empowered to 'SET A DEAL' for Trade into the United States if we are unable to make a deal.\"\nRead more:\nWhat Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\nThe president is also threatening new tariffs in the weeks and months ahead, including new sector-specific tariffs to be announced on items such as semiconductors and pharmaceuticals and possible tariffs aimed at companies like Apple (\nAAPL\n) and Samsung (\n005930.KS\n).\nThe data is significant but could be slightly overstated, with the Treasury Department reporting both customs duties and certain excise taxes as a single category from the Department of Homeland Security.\nExcise taxes are different from customs duties.

Trump has even toyed with the idea that revenue would allow the elimination of income taxes entirely\nMay's uptick in revenues, however, likely still represents less than $1 billion a day and a tiny fraction of all monthly government spending.\nIn April — the most recent full month of data available — the flood of income tax returns brought in over $850 billion to government coffers.\nIn recent decades, tariff revenue has tended to constitute about 2% of federal revenue. The surge in recent months has only slightly changed that, with revenues now accounting for closer to 4%.\nBen Werschkul is a Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\nClick here for political news related to business and money policies that will shape tomorrow's stock prices\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\nTerms\nand\nPrivacy Policy\nPrivacy Dashboard\nMore Info\nRecommended Stories"

Stocks rallied on Tuesday after the European Union agreed to fast-track trade talks with Washington, a diplomatic breakthrough that arrived just as tensions were rising. President Trump announced the US would delay the 50% tariffs on the bloc until July 9.\nThe dynamics of piecemeal trade deals also highlight the limitations of advancing global tariff policy through one-offs, postponements, and agreements to talk further: They don't scale.

That has led to increasingly hostile commentary from both sides, putting\nlast month's agreement to lower tariffs for 90 days\nin a tenuous position.\nNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett even suggested Sunday on ABC that trade negotiations with other nations are being held up by the wait for this call between Trump and Xi.\nHe explained why his previous predictions of deals have failed to materialize, saying it's because \"the trade team has been focused 100% like a laser beam on the China matter.\" Once a call resolves the China issues, he added, \"then we're going to take [other] deals into the Oval.\"\nBut it's far from unclear whether a call between the two leaders, who apparently have not spoken since before Trump's inauguration, can resolve the growing issues. The uncertainty is more pronounced by weeks of promises that a call is in the offing, with still no clarity on when it will even take place.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed hope on CBS for \"something very soon,\" while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick promised on Fox that Trump is \"going to go work it out\" without offering a timeline.\nHassett added he was hoping for a call this week, but said, \"you never know in international relations.\"\nRead more here.\nToday at 12:33 PM UTC\nJenny McCall\nEU readying 'countermeasures' if tariffs deal with US crumbles\nAP reports:\nThe European Union on Monday said it is preparing “countermeasures” against the United States after the Trump administration's surprise\ntariffs on steel\nrattled global markets and complicated the ongoing wider tariff negotiations between Brussels and Washington.\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed last week to “accelerate talks” on a deal, but that if those trade negotiations fail “then we are also prepared to accelerate our work on the defensive side,\" European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told a press conference in Brussels.\n“In the event that our negotiations do not lead to a balanced outcome, the EU is prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to this latest tariff increase,” Gill said.\nRead more here.\nToday at 12:26 PM UTC\nJenny McCall\nAluminium premium for US buyers soars after Trump doubles tariffs\nAluminium (\nALI=F\n) prices for US buyers jumped on Monday after President Trump said he planned to increase tariffs on imported steel and aluminium from 25% to 50%.\nReuters reports:\nThe US is heavily reliant on aluminium imports.

The decision, which came sooner than expected, means the tariffs will remain in effect for now.\nThe US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which oversees the International Trade Court, granted the Trump administration’s request for a temporary administrative stay. This gives the court time to review legal arguments and filings. The administration must submit its briefings by June 9, after which the court will determine the next steps.\nAs Yahoo Finance legal reporter Alexis Keenan noted, Trump has broad authority to impose tariffs through various legal channels, including Sections 232 and 301. The administration had chosen to justify the tariffs under an emergency act, citing concerns such as immigration and drug trafficking — an argument the lower court rejected.\nLegal experts say it’s unclear how the appeals court will ultimately rule, as another court might interpret the emergency authority in a different way.\nThu, May 29, 2025 at 6:31 PM UTC\nAlexandra Canal\nHere's why one strategist sees Trump administration as 'bond vigilant.'\nLong-term Treasury yields have climbed\nin recent weeks\n, driven by growing concerns over the trajectory of US debt as\nPresident Trump's proposed tax legislation\nadvances to the Senate\nafter clearing the House.\nNew concerns emerged late Wednesday after a Manhattan-based trade court\nstruck down a wide swath of Trump's tariffs,\nadding to uncertainty around how the administration will manage the deficit.\n\"The tariffs the court struck down were likely to raise nearly $200 billion on an annual basis,\" Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients late Wednesday.

But sometimes there’s a method to the hostility.\nTrump’s war with elite universities may have started as a personal vendetta. Some people who know Trump say he\nresents Ivy League elitists\nwho have never given him an honorary degree or invited him to deliver a commencement speech. Though Trump himself graduated from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School,\nmultiple bankruptcies\nundermine his own claim to\nbe a highly educated business hotshot\n.\nPermissive cultural environments at many universities have fueled Trump’s “\nwar on wokeness\n.” Anti-Israel protests on several campuses after the 2023 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel\nperplexed many Americans\nwho wondered why the protesting students seemed morally one-sided. All of that made elite schools fatter targets for Trump.\nBut there are also legitimate socioeconomic questions about government policies that confer massive privileges on universities and their students while broadly overlooking millions of Americans who never go to college. Many policy experts think the federal government\noversubsidizes college education\nthrough federally guaranteed student loans that are easy to take out but often hard to repay. Cheap financing probably drives up the cost of a college education by boosting demand, contributing to debt loads that are an overwhelming burden for millions of borrowers.\nNeglect of the working class, meanwhile, is the very thing that fueled Trump’s rise and helped get him elected president, twice. It’s possible to get student loans for trade schools and other forms of non-college education, but if anything, the US has done a\npoor job of helping prepare young Americans not bound for college\nfor rewarding careers that are there for the taking with only the right skills and focus.\nTrump has a knack for identifying and capitalizing on problems other politicians overlook and then overplaying his hand and proposing lousy solutions. On trade, for example, there’s a strong case for rebuilding some domestic manufacturing capacity in key industries, as Trump insists. But Trump’s tariffs are a terrible way to go about it, because those import taxes punish Americans first and leave the US economy weaker, on net, according to most mainstream economists.\nLikewise, there’s a solid premise adjacent to Trump’s war on the college class: that the US needs to invest more in working-class Americans not headed to college. Trump’s call to\ninvest more federal funding in trade schools\n, for instance, echoes many other calls to\nboost worker training\nin the many trades where there aren’t enough skilled workers. There’s already a shortage of hundreds of thousands of welders, carpenters, electricians, and other skilled workers,\naccording to McKinsey\n. Federal aid with that sort of training would actually be a much better idea than imposing new tariffs on imports, because it would help working-class Americans without punishing anybody.\nStory Continues\nDemonstrators rally on Cambridge Common in a protest organized by the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts, calling on Harvard leadership to resist interference at the university by the federal government on April 12, 2025. (Reuters/Nicholas Pfosi/File Photo)\n·\nREUTERS / Reuters\nAs usual, however, one good idea is likely to get lost amid Trump’s braggadocio and the collateral damage of his cultural warfare. Trump hasn’t proposed any kind of rational plan to boost the kind of worker training the US economy needs. He only wants to direct new funding toward trade schools because that would be $3 billion in federal grants he would block Harvard from receiving. Trade schools would only benefit to the extent that Trump is able to punish Harvard and any other school whose federal funds he wants to redirect.\nTrump has a much bigger war plan on the table in his battle with the college establishment. His Republican allies in the House of Representatives have passed a proposal that would\nsharply raise the tax on investment income\nearned at universities with the largest endowments, including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, and several others. It’s not clear if the Senate will approve the plan, but if it does, top schools will be in a scramble to protect their biggest source of wealth.\nTrump has targeted Harvard in particular, moving to\ncancel $3.2 billion in federal grants\nand\n$100 million in federal contracts\n. But this may only be an opening salvo. Trump has\nsuspended visa appointments for foreign students\n, signaling that he may sharply curtail a key source of revenue for many universities. A Trump Justice Dept. official said recently that the government\nplans to go after the University of California system\nand many other schools for perceived anti-semitism. Harvard is challenging Trump's actions in court and other targeted schools are likely to. Courts, so far, have overturned many of Trump's executive actions.\nDrop Rick Newman a note\n, take his\nweekly economy quiz\n, or\nsign up for his newsletter\n.\nFor Trump, the battle against elite institutions is often the whole point. Electoral politics explains why. Non-college-educated working-class voters, especially whites, are Trump’s core constituency. Barack Obama in 2012 was the\nlast Democratic presidential candidate to win a majority of working-class voters\n. From 2012 to 2024, those voters swung from Obama’s Democrats to Trump’s Republicans by 12 percentage points. White working-class voters favored Republicans by 20 points in 2012 and 27 points in 2024.\nThose non-college-educated Americans accounted for 59% of voters in 2024. Few of those voters, who broadly favor Trump, will feel put off by Trump’s attacks on universities, and many of them will approve. For Trump, politically, elite universities are a very safe target.\nThe more important question, however, may be whether Trump’s broadside against the university set will do anything to materially help those who don’t go to college. Probably not. Trump tweeting about moving Harvard money to trade schools doesn’t make it happen. Without follow-up, legislation, and implementation, ideas go nowhere. Trump’s main idea isn’t to help tradespeople, anyway. They only factor into his plans as a by-product of how he might be able to punish Harvard.\nRead more:\nWill I be taxed on student loan forgiveness?\nPresident Biden had a very different approach to education, which arguably failed, contributing to the identity crisis that still plagues Biden’s Democrats. Biden sided fully with college grads and tried to cancel up to $20,000 in student debt for some 26 million borrowers. The Supreme Court struck that down, and Biden attempted a succession of smaller, more targeted efforts to cancel specific types of debt. That hodgepodge of plans ended up\nreducing debt for something like 5 million borrowers\n.\nPolicy experts\ndon’t love student debt cancellation\n, which by definition helps people with college education while doing nothing for less-educated Americans who might benefit more from federal benefits. Voters\ndon’t love it either\n, according to the polls. And in the 2024 presidential election, Democrats lost a lot of ground with younger voters who might be most likely to support debt cancellation.\nTrump, who fashions himself the anti-Biden, has\nhalted Biden’s student debt relief effort\n. Again, that may prove popular with his base without necessarily helping anybody. Trump, meanwhile, has the kernel of an idea to improve on the Biden plan by helping working-class Americans land blue-collar jobs that provide a rewarding career. Hammering Harvard, however, won’t make it happen.\nRick Newman is a senior columnist for\nYahoo Finance\n.

That means China accounted for more than 12% of the company's total revenue.\nNvidia also said it took a $4.5 billion charge due to a write-down in inventory (chips it produced but now can't sell) in the first quarter due to the new export rules —\nless than the $5.5 billion hit expected\n.\n\"We are still evaluating our limited options to supply data center GPU products compliant with the US government's revised export control rules,\" said CFO Colette Kress.\n\"Losing access to the China AI accelerator market, which we believe will grow to nearly $50 billion, would have a material adverse impact on our business going forward, and benefit our foreign competitors in China and worldwide.\"\nSingapore was once again the second-largest market for Nvidia, which gets over half of its revenue (53%) from abroad.

AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate. Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure — just like electricity and the internet — and NVIDIA stands at the center of this profound transformation.\nWed, May 28, 2025 at 8:23 PM UTC\nMyles Udland\nNvidia earnings Wall Street forecasts as China export controls shift results\nNvidia's first quarter results on Wednesday came in a bit shy of Wall Street estimates, with adjusted earnings per share and revenue in its data center business falling short of expectations.\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia earned $0.96 per share on an adjusted basis, which excludes charges related to export controls and associated tax implications, with headline revenue coming in at $44.1 billion. Diluted earnings per share came in at $0.81.\nWall Street expected the company to report adjusted earnings per share of $0.88 on revenue of $43.3 billion, according to estimates from Bloomberg. A year ago, Nvidia reported adjusted EPS of $0.61 on revenue of $26 billion.\nNvidia's data center business — which captures spending on its AI chips — tallied revenue of $39.1 billion, just below the $39.22 billion forecasted by the Street.\nShares of the company were up about 3% in extended trading in immediate reaction to the numbers.\nWed, May 28, 2025 at 6:31 PM UTC\nGrace O'Donnell\nThe pros and cons of investing in Nvidia heading into earnings\nNvidia (\nNVDA\n) stock has rallied hard in May, gaining 24% in the past month.\nThat leaves many investors wondering if it's a good time to pile into the stock ahead of the chip giant's earnings report. We've pointed out here that\nNvidia stock tends to swing 7%\nin either direction the day after it reports. My colleague Laura Bratton has also noted that\nNvidia's earnings often surprise Wall Street\n.\nAccording to tastylive founder and CEO Tom Sosnoff, volatility in the stock is low, even heading into earnings, suggesting that \"the expectations are for something rangebound to happen.\"\nSosnoff outlined several key points investors should keep in mind when determining whether to invest in a popular name like Nvidia:\nPros:\n\"It’s super liquid,\" Sosnoff said on\nWealth\n. \"It's got a very liquid derivatives marketplace. So you can do lots of different strategies and things like that.\"\nSosnoff also pointed out that Nvidia remains a market leader. \"It’s the bluest of all blue chips right now,\" he said.\nCons:\nA major con, according to Sosnoff, is that \"it’s a crowded trade. Nvidia is pretty fully priced.\"\nHe added that \"for the first time, we're not seeing any call skew in there, which means that the derivatives markets, which are pretty good at pricing upside expectations, are kind of mixed right now. They're saying, 'you know what, upside and downside, we have similar expectations.'\"\n\"So I think the con is that if Nvidia misses, there’s pretty decent pot odds that the downside move could be greater than the upside move if they hit it,\" he explained.\nWed, May 28, 2025 at 4:00 PM UTC\nGrace O'Donnell\nChart: How Nvidia ran away from the competition\nYahoo Finance's Josh Schafer highlighted one chart that shows how Nvidia became the dominant chipmaker and one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalization of over $3 trillion:\nThere's perhaps no clearer way to see how Nvidia ran away from the competition in the AI boom than looking at the company's market capitalization against its peers. Back when ChatGPT launched, Nvidia had a market cap of just over $400 billion. It's now over $3.2 trillion. Over that same time period, chip competitor Intel's (\nINTC\n) market cap has actually decreased, while Advanced Micro Devices' (\nAMD\n) market cap has increased incrementally from $125 billion to $177 billion.\nCheck out more charts like this that show Nvidia's rise\n.\nWed, May 28, 2025 at 3:12 PM UTC\nGrace O'Donnell\nNvidia earnings topped forecasts by 10% over past 2 years, double the S&P 500 average\nYahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports:\nNvidia's (\nNVDA\n) earnings and revenue beat Wall Street's expectations nearly every quarter over the past two years.\nOver the past eight quarters, Nvidia's earnings per share exceeded Wall Street's projections by an average of 9.8%. Over that same time frame, Nvidia's quarterly revenue beat the Street by an average of 8.9%.\nMeanwhile, S&P 500 companies reported earnings and sales roughly 5% and 1.3% above Wall Street's expectations in that time frame, according to Bloomberg data.\nOnly once in that period — during the second quarter of its fiscal year 2025 — did Nvidia's earnings miss forecasts. Its revenue has exceeded forecasts during each of the past eight quarters.\n\"We expect largely inline results and outlook despite the negative top-line impact related to recently disclosed H20 restrictions,\" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy wrote in a May 22 note to investors, citing \"demand for H200, coupled with initial GB200 ramps.\"\nRead more here.\nWed, May 28, 2025 at 2:29 PM UTC\nGrace O'Donnell\n3 things Nvidia investors should look out for in its earnings call\nThe countdown to Nvidia's earnings has begun.\nBeyond the top and bottom line figures, which Wall Street expects to be solid, Yahoo Finance's\nBrian Sozzi\nand\nBrooke Sweeney\nhave compiled three things that investors should watch out for:\n1. Pay close attention to comments about AI demand and data center growth\nNvidia's data center segment, driven by AI chips like the H100 and its Blackwell platform, accounts for the lion's share of its revenue. Analysts will be listening for signals about cloud providers and hyperscalers like Amazon (\nAMZN\n), Microsoft (\nMSFT\n), and Google (\nGOOG\n).\nAre they still placing large orders? Are there any hints of softening demand or delayed deployments? If so, that could rattle investor confidence in the AI infrastructure build-out and Nvidia's future.\n2. Keep an eye on comments about Nvidia's gross profit margins, which are under pressure\nNvidia has been benefiting from premium pricing on its high-performance chips. But with increasing competition from AMD (\nAMD\n) and custom silicon efforts from Big Tech companies, margins may come under more pressure. Investors will want to know if Nvidia is maintaining its pricing power or if it's beginning to feel cost compression, especially as it prepares for the high-volume rollout of Blackwell chips.\n3. It's all about guidance\nInvestors want to know whether demand is still accelerating or beginning to plateau. Any hint of slowing revenue or capital expenditures from key customers could prompt a reassessment of Nvidia's valuation. On the flip side, a bullish forecast — especially tied to Blackwell adoption or new enterprise use cases — could reignite momentum.\nAlso listen for updates on supply chain capacity, chip-launch timelines, and geopolitical risks.\nRead more here.\nWed, May 28, 2025 at 2:05 PM UTC\nGrace O'Donnell\nNvidia stock wavers in early trading ahead of earnings\nNvidia stock (\nNVDA\n) opened modestly higher ahead of its earnings report but fluctuated in early trading.

The release comes as investors have been closely watching data releases for signs of how President Trump's tariff policy is impacting the economy.\nThe \"core\" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, rose 2.5% on an annual basis, in line with expectations and lower than the 2.7% seen in March. Core prices rose 0.1% in April from the prior month, in line with expectations and the monthly increase seen in March.\nOn a yearly basis, PCE increased by 2.1%, below the 2.2% economists had expected.\nThe release is\nyet another sign\nthat while economists and consumers alike\nexpect Trump's tariffs to push prices higher\n, the inflationary impact from policy largely isn't showing up in hard economic data. Friday morning's release reflects the month of April, the first month in which a large portion of Trump's tariffs were in effect.\nIt does not include any impacts from the 90-day tariff pause between the US and China.\n\"The increased tariffs have not yet worked their way into the consumer inflation readings, but we anticipate that the improved inflation trend will reverse in the second half of the year as companies are forced to begin passing along a portion of the increased tariffs in order to protect profit margins,\" Nationwide chief economist Kathy Bostjancic wrote in a research note on Friday.\nRead more:\nWhat Trump's tariffs mean for the economy and your wallet\nOn Wednesday, minutes from the Federal Reserve's May meeting revealed officials are growing increasingly concerned about how Trump's policies could impact its fight against inflation.\n\"Almost all participants commented on the risk that inflation could prove to be more persistent than expected,\" the minutes read.\nInvestors and consumers alike have been closely watching for any price increases due to President Trump's tariffs.

That has worked well in the past, but is unlikely to work well in the era of Trump tariffs.\nInvestors just got a taste of the tariff impact from computing giant HP.\nThe company missed earnings estimates by a country mile and cut guidance after the close, blaming tariff impacts.\nI just hopped off the phone with HP CEO Enrique Lores. Here are three comments from him that stood out:\n\"Tariffs announced in April were higher and impacted more countries than we were expecting, and this clearly has impacted the operating profit that we had in the quarter.\"\nNow by June, we expect almost no product coming to North America coming from China. So it's a very significant change.\"\n“We have moved production from China into Vietnam, Thailand, Mexico, some to India, and some to the US.”\n“We are exploring if it will make sense to increase our capacity [in the US], and we are doing a lot of work to see whether this will be a viable option from a cost perspective. At this point, no decisions have been made.”\nLores added that HP has been raising prices to offset the tariffs. He declined to share a percentage amount.

      "content": "Nvidia beats on Q1 revenue, warns of $8 billion sales hit in Q2 from H20 export ban\nDaniel Howley\n·\nTechnology Editor\nUpdated\nThu, May 29, 2025 at 5:25 PM GMT+8\n4 min read\nIn This Article:\nStockStory Top Pick\nNVDA\n+0.76%\nCRWV\n+3.39%\nFXCOF\n0.00%\nNvidia (\nNVDA\n)\nreported its first quarter earnings\nafter the bell on Wednesday, beating expectations on revenue but falling short on adjusted earnings per share (EPS) due to the impact of the ban on shipments of its H20 chips to China. The company also said it expects to miss out on roughly $8 billion in sales of H20s in the second quarter.\nNvidia stock was up 5% in premarket trading on Thursday following the announcement.\nNasdaqGS - Nasdaq Real Time Price\n•\nUSD\nNVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\n136.14\n+1.01\n+(0.76%)\nAs of 10:10:41 AM EDT. Market Open.\nNVDA\nAMD\nINTC\nAdvanced Chart\nFor the quarter, Nvidia reported EPS of $0.81 on revenue of $44.1 billion, compared to analysts' expectations of $0.93 on revenue of $43.3 billion, according to Bloomberg analyst consensus data. Without the charge for the H20 chips in Q1, adjusted EPS would have topped out at $0.96.\nThe company reported adjusted EPS of $0.61 on revenue of $26 billion in the same period last year.\nNvidia's data center segment, its largest business, saw revenue of $39.1 billion, up from $22.5 billion last year but behind Wall Street expectations of $39.2 billion.\nAccording to Nvidia CFO Colette Kress, Nvidia generated just under 50% of its data center revenue via hyperscalers like Amazon (\nAMZN\n), Google (\nGOOG\n), and Microsoft (\nMSFT\n).\n\"Global demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure is incredibly strong,\" CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.\n\"AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate. Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure — just like electricity and the internet — and Nvidia stands at the center of this profound transformation,” he said.\nNvidia had to write down $4.5 billion in charges related to the Trump administration's ban on sales of its H20 chip to China. The company announced the news\nin an April regulatory filing\n.\nNvidia's shares have fluctuated wildly since the start of the year as the company has dealt with setbacks ranging from export controls to concerns related to expected semiconductor tariffs.\nBut a last-minute reprieve from Washington's planned AI diffusion rule, which was put in place by the Biden administration to limit GPU sales to certain countries, and major investment announcements during Trump's visit to the Middle East have increased Nvidia's share price to more than $136 — slightly less than 2% up from the stock's value at the start of the year, and up roughly 20% over the past 12 months as of Wednesday.\nNvidia's report follows the company's showing at the annual Computex Taipei trade show in Taiwan, where it showcased new technologies, such as a cloud offering that gives customers access to cloud-based versions of Nvidia's GPUs via third-party providers like CoreWeave (\nCRWV\n) and Foxconn (\n2354.TW\n).\nStory Continues\nNvidia specifically designed the H20 to meet the Biden administration's restrictions on AI chips destined for China. But DeepSeek sent shockwaves through Washington and Wall Street when it proved it could produce powerful AI models using below top-of-the-line Nvidia chips. As a result, Trump imposed tighter restrictions on the company's chips, banning the sale of H20s in the country.\n\"There is simply no offset to this,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore wrote in an investor note ahead of the earnings report.\n\"Blackwell demand is very strong ... but they are supply constrained, and lost H20 does not result in more Blackwell supply. We assume that this takes about $1 billion out of the April [quarter] — impact was effective April 7, so 23 days of lost H20 revenue—and about $5 billion of lost revenue in July. We actually think demand for H20 is much higher, driven by the surge of inference in China.\"\nAccording to Reuters\n, Nvidia is now working on a modified version of the H20 that meets the Trump administration's performance requirements.\nDuring a press conference at Computex, Huang came out swinging against the US's policies, saying that they've been a failure and that they benefit China's own AI chipmakers,\naccording to Bloomberg\n.\nNvidia received relief from some export restrictions when the Trump administration axed the Biden administration's planned AI diffusion rules, which would have created a tiered system that determined which countries could purchase AI chips and which required special licenses or couldn't get them at all. The administration plans to introduce a new set of export requirements in the future.\nJensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia, speaks during a news conference in Taipei on May 21. (I-Hwa Cheng/AFP via Getty Images)\n·\nI-HWA CHENG via Getty Images\nThe move set up Nvidia's announcement that it will provide\nhundreds of thousands of GPUs over the next five years to Humain\n, an artificial intelligence startup backed by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. The news came during Trump's trip to the Middle East, which also included the\nannouncement of a second Project Stargate\nthat will be built in the United Arab Emirates using Nvidia's Blackwell systems.\n\"For investors worried about AI capex sustainability, we now have another deep pocketed customer willing and capable to spend large amounts of money on a clearly strategic push as Saudi Arabia attempts to position itself as a regional and global AI hub,\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in an investor note.\nSign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\n·\nyahoofinance\nRead more about Nvidia's earnings:\nNvidia to report Q1 earnings as Middle East deals, export control reprieve boost stock\nHow Nvidia 'played a central role' in the $306 billion AI startup boom\nWhy Nvidia's rise could signal bad news for climate goals\nNvidia's bear case: Is the hype train running out of tracks?\nBig Tech's spending drove Nvidia's rise\nNvidia China revenue set to cross $6 billion in Q1 as investors brace for export ban impact\n3 things Nvidia investors should look out for in its earnings call\nNvidia earnings topped forecasts by 10% over past 2 years\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

More resiliency.\nBut the story of job hunting in America has been far more bifurcated, masked by these broad figures. Behind the solid headline numbers is a hiring rate hovering near a decade low. So too is the rate at which Americans are quitting their jobs.\nAs Fed Chair Jerome Powell put it on Jan 29, \"It's a low hiring environment. So if you have a job, it's all good. But if you have to find a job, [the] hiring rates have come down.\"\nIt's yet another tale of two economies, and one that's hammering a specific group: recent college grads.\nWith the labor market stuck in neutral, the millions of students who walked off the campus quad for the final time this month are facing a challenging situation.\nThe three-month moving average of the unemployment rate for recent graduates aged 22 to 27 currently sits at roughly 5.3%, well above the national average of 4.2%, per Oxford Economics. As our Chart of the Week shows, this is a historic anomaly.\n\"It's a first sign of hitting a point where the labor market is at kind of a breaking point,\" Indeed economist Cory Stahle told Yahoo Finance. \"Things overall are still solid, but the fact that we're seeing pockets like these younger workers starting to get hit harder is clearly very concerning.\"\nThe story of these workers, why they aren't finding jobs, and whether or not they eventually will is at the crux of the current US labor market conundrum.\n\"Right now, we're on a trend where we're facing a lot of headwinds,\" Stahle said. \"The labor market is strong, but my prediction right now is some of these headwinds are going to start catching up to us.\"\nBig Tech's \"efficiency\" push\nhas been a key driver of the recent graduate job-hunting slump.\nRecent research\nfrom Apollo Global Management's chief economist Torsten Sløk shows that employment in the Magnificent Seven tech cohort had increased at 13% or higher from 2011 to 2021. In the past three years, employment gains for the group were only around 3% in any given year. And these are the big, wealthy companies that are still growing and driving S&P 500 earnings.\n(Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.)\nStory Continues\nThis means fewer tech job openings for a generation of college students who\nhave been increasingly majoring in areas like computer science.\nJob postings on Indeed's platform for software development jobs are down about 40% from February 2020, per Stahle.\nA far cry from the \"learn to code\" era\n.\nAdd in that the broader labor market had already been cooling, many expect President Trump's tariffs to weigh on economic growth, and artificial intelligence\nis beginning to fill entry-level positions\n, and Oxford Economics US senior economist Matthew Martin described a \"perfect storm\" that's keeping college grads on the labor market sidelines.\n\"There's just such a smaller pool of jobs to actually compete for, which means a lot of these recent grads are unfortunately staying unemployed as soon as they enter the labor force,\" Martin told Yahoo Finance.\nMartin added that the data isn't large enough to ominously change his economic forecast. But it is one of the dynamics under the surface that has economists predicting the likely path for the unemployment rate from here isn't lower.\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The decision, which came sooner than expected, means the tariffs will remain in effect for now.\nThe US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which oversees the International Trade Court, granted the Trump administration’s request for a temporary administrative stay. This gives the court time to review legal arguments and filings. The administration must submit its briefings by June 9, after which the court will determine the next steps.\nAs Yahoo Finance legal reporter Alexis Keenan noted, Trump has broad authority to impose tariffs through various legal channels, including Sections 232 and 301. The administration had chosen to justify the tariffs under an emergency act, citing concerns such as immigration and drug trafficking — an argument the lower court rejected.\nLegal experts say it’s unclear how the appeals court will ultimately rule, as another court might interpret the emergency authority in a different way.\nThu, May 29, 2025 at 6:31 PM UTC\nAlexandra Canal\nHere's why one strategist sees Trump administration as 'bond vigilant.'\nLong-term Treasury yields have climbed\nin recent weeks\n, driven by growing concerns over the trajectory of US debt as\nPresident Trump's proposed tax legislation\nadvances to the Senate\nafter clearing the House.\nNew concerns emerged late Wednesday after a Manhattan-based trade court\nstruck down a wide swath of Trump's tariffs,\nadding to uncertainty around how the administration will manage the deficit.\n\"The tariffs the court struck down were likely to raise nearly $200 billion on an annual basis,\" Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients late Wednesday. That's \"roughly the amount the fiscal package would increase the deficit next year.\"\nYields ticked higher in the immediate aftermath of the news before falling slightly on Thursday. In afternoon trade, 10-year (\n^TNX\n) hovered near 4.43% while the 30-year (\n^TYX\n) traded around 4.94%.\nAs bond markets digest the latest policy whipsaw, one strategist says investors may be underestimating just how actively the administration is working behind the scenes to manage long-term borrowing costs.\nCboe Indices\n•\nUSD\nTreasury Yield 30 Years (^TYX)\nFollow\nView Quote Details\n4.9700\n+0.0410\n+(0.83%)\nAs of 8:55:43 AM CDT.

The uncertainty is more pronounced by weeks of promises that a call is in the offing, with still no clarity on when it will even take place.\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed hope on CBS for \"something very soon,\" while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick promised on Fox that Trump is \"going to go work it out\" without offering a timeline.\nHassett added he was hoping for a call this week, but said, \"you never know in international relations.\"\nRead more here.\nToday at 12:33 PM UTC\nJenny McCall\nEU readying 'countermeasures' if tariffs deal with US crumbles\nAP reports:\nThe European Union on Monday said it is preparing “countermeasures” against the United States after the Trump administration's surprise\ntariffs on steel\nrattled global markets and complicated the ongoing wider tariff negotiations between Brussels and Washington.\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed last week to “accelerate talks” on a deal, but that if those trade negotiations fail “then we are also prepared to accelerate our work on the defensive side,\" European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told a press conference in Brussels.\n“In the event that our negotiations do not lead to a balanced outcome, the EU is prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to this latest tariff increase,” Gill said.\nRead more here.\nToday at 12:26 PM UTC\nJenny McCall\nAluminium premium for US buyers soars after Trump doubles tariffs\nAluminium (\nALI=F\n) prices for US buyers jumped on Monday after President Trump said he planned to increase tariffs on imported steel and aluminium from 25% to 50%.\nReuters reports:\nThe US is heavily reliant on aluminium imports.

Some analysts estimated those costs could translate to an earnings hit of about $0.25 a share.\nGap said it's continuing to shift away from China and diversify its supply chain more broadly. By the end of 2026, the company said no single country would represent more than 25% of its sourcing.\nRead more here.\nSat, May 31, 2025 at 1:55 PM UTC\nAlexis Keenan\nThe Nixon-era tariff fight that could help Trump\nPresident Trump is looking to former President Nixon as proof that his\nglobal tariffs\nshould be allowed to stand in court.\nRoughly five decades ago, 10% duties unilaterally imposed by the 37th president as part of a set of economic measures dubbed the \"Nixon shock\" were challenged in court in much\nthe same way\nas Trump's 2025 tariffs have been.\nThe US Court of International Trade\nstruck down many of Trump's tariffs Wednesday\n, just as Nixon's duties suffered an initial defeat. An appeals court on Thursday allowed Trump's duties to temporarily stay in place while legal arguments continue.\nWhat has emboldened the Trump administration is that the Nixon-era Justice Department eventually won its case on appeal, an outcome the Trump administration cited in court documents this week, predicting that its legal saga would likely turn out the same way.\nIt told the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that \"the Federal Circuit's predecessor concluded that the very same language that today exists\" in a law used by Trump to justify his tariffs \"gave President Nixon the power to impose an import duty surcharge.\"\nRead the full story here.\nWASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 29: President Richard Nixon at a news conference.

Tesla's long-range Model Y and Model 3 vehicles contain 87.5% \"total domestic content,\" according to a\n2024 study by Kelley Blue Book\n.\n\"It used to bother me, [automakers] make a part in Canada, a part in Mexico, a part in Europe, and sent all over the place, and nobody knew what the hell was happening,\" Trump continued. \"I think you build a car, make it in America. ... over the next year, they've got to have the whole thing built in America.\"\nThe US imposed\nauto tariffs of 25%\non May 3, but the Trump administration carved out an exemption for some auto parts tariffs, stating that they would not be stacked on top of other tariffs. The auto industry has lobbied hard for tariff exemptions since Trump took office.\nWhile many of Trump's most extreme tariffs are being challenged in court, those cases\ndo not affect auto tariffs\n, which were implemented using a separate law.\nFri, May 30, 2025 at 6:35 PM UTC\nGrace O'Donnell\nTrump says he'll speak with Xi Jinping but doesn't mention specifics\nIn a press conference with Tesla (\nTSLA\n) CEO Elon Musk on Friday afternoon, President Trump repeated his claim that China \"violated a big part of the agreement we made.\"\nTrump also stated that he expects to have a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, though he didn't offer any definite details about when such a call would take place.\n\"I'm sure that I'll speak to President Xi, and hopefully we'll work that out,\" the president said.\nTrump has not yet spoken with his Chinese counterpart during his second term. He previously said he expected to speak with Xi in mid-May after the US and China announced a temporary tariff pause, but that call never occurred.\nTrump's comments come as trade tensions between the US and China ratchet up again.

Goods imports decreased $68.4 billion to $276.1 billion. Exports of goods increased $6.3 billion to $188.5 billion.\nA rush to beat import duties pushed the goods trade deficit to a record high in March. The front-running of imports is probably not over. Higher duties for most countries have been postponed until July, while those for Chinese goods have been delayed until mid-August amid negotiations between President Donald Trump's administration and trade partners.\nRead more here.\nFri, May 30, 2025 at 12:36 PM UTC\nGrace O'Donnell\nTrump says China 'TOTALLY VIOLATED' agreement\nThe temporary trade deal that led to the US and China pausing steep tariffs is showing signs of fraying.\nIn a\npost on Truth Social\non Friday, President Trump made it clear who he thinks is to blame.\n\"I made a FAST DEAL with China in order to save them from what I thought was going to be a very bad situation, and I didn’t want to see that happen,\" Trump said. \"Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual.
